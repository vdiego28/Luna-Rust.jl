## 1. The propagated quantity

Luna integrates the unidirectional pulse-propagation equation (UPPE), or its
envelope reduction (GNLSE), in the spectral domain. The state vector `y` is the
frequency-domain field:

- **RealGrid** (carrier-resolved): `y = Eω`, the real-input FFT (`rfft`) of the
  real field `E(t)`. Length `Nω = Nt÷2 + 1`.
- **EnvGrid** (envelope): `y = Eω`, the full complex FFT (`fft`) of the complex
  envelope. Length `Nω = Nt`.

The PDE in `z` has the schematic form

```
∂z Eω = L(ω, z) · Eω  +  N[Eω](z)
```

where `L` is the **diagonal linear operator** (dispersion β(ω) + loss + a moving
reference frame) and `N` is the **nonlinear RHS** (Kerr, plasma, Raman, …),
assembled in the time/space domain and transformed back to ω.

## 2. Interaction-picture Dormand-Prince 5(4)

The stiffness lives in `L`. Luna removes it analytically by integrating in the
**interaction picture**: define `ybar = exp(-L·(z-z₀))·Eω`. The linear part is
then exact and the adaptive RK integrates only the (smooth) nonlinear part.

In code this is the **preconditioned RHS** `fbar!` (`src/RK45.jl:309-319`):

```
fbar!(out, ybar, t1, t2):
    y   ← ybar
    prop!(y,   t1, t2)        # forward:  y *= exp(L·(t2-t1))
    f!(out, y, t2)            # nonlinear RHS at t2
    prop!(out, t1, t2, bwd=true)   # back:  out *= exp(L·(t1-t2))
```

i.e. **`fbar! = prop_back ∘ f! ∘ prop_forward`**. The propagator is a pure
diagonal phase multiply (`src/RK45.jl:281-306`):

```
prop!(y, t1, t2):       y .*= exp.(L .* (t2 - t1))     # const-linop case
```

For a z-dependent `L`, `prop!` integrates `L` to the later time and caches it
(`src/RK45.jl:294-306`). Native code must reproduce the same "evaluate L at the
later time, reuse if unchanged" memoization to stay bit-comparable.

### 2.1 Tableau, FSAL, error estimate
Standard Dormand-Prince 5(4) (7 stages, the coefficients live in
`src/dopri.jl`). Properties the native loop must preserve exactly:

- **FSAL** (First Same As Last): stage 7 of the accepted step is stage 1 of the
  next — one RHS evaluation per step is reused, not recomputed.
- **Propagated solution:** default `locextrap=true` advances the fifth-order
  DOPRI5 state; `locextrap=false` advances the embedded fourth-order state.
  Both are formed explicitly from their respective weights rather than relying
  on a residual stage buffer. The error vector is `yerr = y4 - y5` (the sign
  is immaterial to the norm but its fixed coefficient values are shared by all
  backends).
- **Dense output**: the current default is the
  Calvo–Montijano–Rández order-5 continuous extension. It evaluates extra
  stages lazily for an interval that is actually sampled
  (`native_compute_extra_stages` on the resident path), then both Julia and
  native steppers use the shared `interpC5` coefficients. The older 7-stage
  `interpC` order-4 extension remains as a fallback. The 2026-07-23 work also
  fixed an inherited FSAL bug: carrying k7→k1 at accept time destroyed the
  completed interval's k1 before interpolation and collapsed both extensions
  to first order. FSAL carry is now deferred to the top of the next step.
  See `PORT_LOG.md`'s latest entry and
  `portlog-inbox/dense-order5.md`.

### 2.1a Per-step external field mutation must be pushed back to Rust (Phase 8)
`Luna.run`'s `stepfun` callback (grid frequency/time windowing) mutates the
field **after** each accepted step, and for `PreconStepper` that mutation is
free (it's the same live array used as the next step's starting state). A
resident-field design has no such freebie: `RustNativeStepper`'s `native_step`
starts every call from Rust's *own* internally-tracked field, not from
whatever Julia last wrote into the FFI-shared buffer. Any code path that
mutates the field between `step!` calls (currently: `stepfun`'s windowing)
**must** be followed by a call that pushes the change back into the resident
state, or it is silently discarded — this bit Phase 8 badly (see PORT_LOG).
The fix is `_native_field_resync!(s)` (`src/RK45.jl`, a no-op for every
stepper except `RustNativeStepper`), called right after `stepfun` in the
generic `solve(s, tmax; stepfun, ...)` loop, via a new `native_resync_field`
FFI. It deliberately does **not** recompute the FSAL stage-0 RHS (unlike the
construction-time `set_field`, which correctly does, for the no-history
initial-condition case) — Julia's own `PreconStepper` doesn't re-evaluate the
nonlinear RHS after windowing either, it only re-propagates the FSAL-carried
last stage linearly into the new frame, and matching that (not "improving" on
it) is what reproduces Julia's number.

### 2.2 Lund PI step controller
The accepted/rejected decision uses a normalized error `err = norm(yerr, y, yn,
rtol, atol)`; the next step size uses a proportional-integral law (Lund / Söderlind):

```
dt_new = dt · safety · err^(-α) · err_prev^(β)
```

with the standard DP5 exponents. Bit-comparability of the *trajectory* requires
the identical `err` reduction (`weaknorm` / `maxnorm`, `src/RK45.jl:321+`),
the same `safety`, and the same accept/reject threshold — otherwise the two
paths take different step sequences and diverge within the tolerance band even
when each RHS is bit-identical. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) §nondeterminism.

## 3. The nonlinear RHS `f!` per geometry

`f!` is a `Trans*` functor (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl`). The shared shape:

```
f!(out, Eω, z):
    1. to_time!(Et, Eω)          # ω → t  (inverse FFT, possibly oversampled grid FTo)
    2. fill Pt from responses(Et)  # Kerr / plasma / Raman, in the time (and space) domain
    3. to_freq!(Pω, Pt)          # t → ω  (forward FFT)
    4. out ← prefactor(ω, z) .* Pω   # geometry normalization + i·ω/(2ε₀c) type factor
```

The geometries differ in steps 1/3 (which transform) and step 4 (normalization):

### 3.1 Mode-averaged — `TransModeAvg` (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:531`) — Phase 1 (RealGrid) / Phase 2 (EnvGrid)
No spatial transform. Pure 1-D FFT pair plus an effective-area scaling
(`norm_mode_average`). The simplest geometry; the reference implementation for
the resident-field architecture. Phase 1 ported the RealGrid (r2c/c2r) Kerr
path (`rhs_mode_avg_real`); Phase 2 extended it to the EnvGrid (c2c) envelope
path (`rhs_mode_avg_env`), which needs the 3/4 SVEA prefactor on `Kerr_env`
that the carrier-resolved Kerr term doesn't (§5.1).

### 3.2 Radial — `TransRadial` (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:663`) — Phase 3, ported
The field carries a radial axis: buffers are `(n_time, n_r)`, and each RHS
wraps the time transform with a **QDHT** (`mul!`/`ldiv!` with the Hankel `T`
matrix) on the `r ↔ k` axis:
```
to_time!(Eto, Eω)        # ω → t, per r-column (batched dim-1 FFT in Julia)
_qdht_ldiv!(Eto, QDHT)   # k → r
Et_to_Pt!(Pto, Eto, ...) # Kerr, pointwise in (t, r) — same E³ formula as Phase 1
Pto .*= towin
_qdht_mul!(Pto, QDHT)    # r → k
to_freq!(nl, Pto)        # t → ω, per r-column
nl .*= ωwin .* (-im·ω) ./ (2 .* normfun(z))
```

**Reuse, don't reinvent — the resident QDHT is already built.** `ffi.rs`'s
`QdhtFfiHandle` (used by the existing `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT` FFI wiring) already
holds Julia's `T` matrix in the correct convention and exposes
`apply_real(data, n_time, scale)` / `apply_cplx(data, n_time, scale)` as plain
Rust methods operating on a column-major `(n_time, n_r)` buffer — not just an
FFI entry point. Phase 3 stores a `QdhtFfiHandle` instance directly inside
`NativeSim` (built once in `native_set_radial_params` from Julia's `HT.T`,
`HT.N`, `HT.scaleRK`) and calls `apply_real`/`apply_cplx` directly from
`rhs_radial` — no FFI round-trip per RHS, no reimplementation of the QDHT
math. Do **not** use `diffraction::Qdht` (a different Rust-native struct with
its own T-matrix convention) — it does not match Julia's normalization
(CLAUDE.md gotcha).

As of 2026-08-24, the resident handle chooses the same transform through a
three-state execution policy. `auto` uses Julia's configured BLAS provider when
`n_time*n_r*n_r ≥ 4096`; smaller work, explicit `off`, and deterministic mode
use the row-wise Rayon formula. Explicit `on` forces BLAS when the provider is
available. Both kernels apply the same Julia-supplied `T` and scale; only their
summation order differs, so they live in the reassociation tolerance tier.

**FFT: loop the existing rank-1 plan over columns, don't add `plan_many`
yet.** Julia's `plan_rfft(xt, 1)` is a batched ("many") transform over the
`n_r` columns; the native side reuses the existing single-vector
`ComplexFft1d`/`RealFft1d` (`fftw.rs`) called `n_r` times in a loop instead
of adding a new batched FFTW plan type. This is simpler and the established
~1e-13 tolerance tier is the safety net — only add `plan_many` if single-step
equivalence comes in worse than that tier for a reason traced to the FFT
step specifically.

**Normalization: precompute one complex `(n_ω, n_r)` array, don't port
`norm_radial`'s Bessel/k_z math into Rust.** The tail of `TransRadial`'s
`__call__` is `nl .*= ωwin .* (-im·ω) ./ (2 .* normfun(z))`. Precompute
`M[iω,ir] = ωwin[iω] * (-im*ω[iω]) / (2 * normfun_array[iω,ir])` once in
Julia and pass it to Rust as a flat array; `rhs_radial` just does
`ks[idx][i] *= M[i]` elementwise on the flattened buffer. This captures the
`ω=0`/evanescent (`βsq≤0`) masking and `ωwin` for free, and needs zero of
`norm_radial`'s math ported. **This is only valid for a z-invariant
`normfun`** (i.e. `const_norm_radial`, constant-medium gas cell) — exactly
the same constant-medium restriction Phases 1-6 already carry for the linop
(§6, ARCHITECTURE §4.4). A z-dependent `normfun` (tapered fiber, pressure
gradient) is out of scope until Phase 7 alongside the z-dependent linop.

**The linop is 2-D for radial**, `(n_ω, n_r)` (`LinearOps.make_const_linop`
with a `Hankel.QDHT` grid — `k_z = √((nω/c)² − k_r²)` depends on both `ω` and
`k_r`), not the `Vector{ComplexF64}` Phases 1-2 assumed. `apply_prop` stays
purely elementwise on the flattened column-major buffer, so no Rust change is
needed there — but the Julia-side native-path guard in `RK45.solve_precon`
(`src/RK45.jl:27`, currently `linop isa Vector{ComplexF64}`) must broaden to
also accept `Matrix{ComplexF64}`, or radial never reaches the native
constructor at all.

**Invariant (state explicitly, don't let it drift):** every 2-D buffer touched
by `rhs_radial` — `Eto`/`Pto` (time domain), `Eωo`/`Pωo` (oversampled
frequency), the flattened `ks[i]`/`field` buffers — is **column-major
`(n_time, n_r)`**, i.e. one r-column is `n_time` contiguous elements. This is
what `QdhtFfiHandle::apply_real/apply_cplx` expects, and what makes each
column contiguous for the looped rank-1 FFT. If any buffer ever disagrees with
this layout, the result is silent garbage, not a crash.

**Tolerance heads-up:** the QDHT carries a ~1e-13 BLAS-vs-Rayon summation-order
floor (CLAUDE.md), applied *twice* per RHS call (`ldiv!` + `mul!`) inside the
stepper now. Radial's single-step tier will land around low-1e-13 to ~1e-12,
not the cleaner sub-1e-13 Phase 1/2 FFTW-only tier — that is the QDHT floor,
not a bug; do not chase it lower. Apply the Phase 2 lesson from the start:
build the full-solve equivalence test with `max_dt=min_dt=dt` (fixed step
size) so it measures state accumulation, not adaptive-path agreement.

**Scope implemented:** RealGrid + scalar Kerr only (`Nonlinear.Kerr_field`,
the same `E³` formula already in `rhs_mode_avg_real`, applied per r-column),
`shotnoise=false` (skips the `Et_noise` branch). EnvGrid-radial and
plasma-radial are deferred follow-ups, mirroring how Phase 1 preceded Phase
2's EnvGrid/plasma extension.

### 3.3 Modal — `TransModal` (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:421`) — Phase 5, ported (narrow scope)
The nonlinear polarization is projected onto each waveguide mode by an
**overlap integral** evaluated with adaptive cubature (`pointcalc!`,
`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:363-399`; `Erω_to_Prω!`, `:401-419`). Per cubature node
`(r,θ)`: mode-field synthesis (`to_space!`: sum `Emω` weighted by each mode's
`Exy(r,θ,z)` → physical field `Erω`) → `to_time!` → nonlinear response
(`Et_to_Pt!`) → `towin` → `to_freq!` → `ωwin`/`norm!` → re-project onto modes
(`Prω · transpose(Ems)`) → scale by the polar Jacobian `2π·r` → return to the
cubature routine as one component of the vector integrand.

**Reuse, don't reinvent — bind the same C `libcubature`, don't write an
adaptive-cubature algorithm.** `Cubature.jl` is a thin `ccall` wrapper around
Steven Johnson's C library (`Cubature_jll`, symbols `hcubature_v`/
`pcubature_v`), not a pure-Julia reimplementation — confirmed via
`Cubature.Cubature_jll.libcubature` (an artifact path) and
`nm -D libcubature.so` (exports `hcubature_v`/`pcubature_v`/`hcubature`/
`pcubature`). This is exactly `FFTW.FFTW_jll.libfftw3`'s shape: `native.rs`
`dlopen`s the identical binary Julia calls (path passed in from Julia, same
`Library` loader pattern as `fftw.rs`), and Rust's per-node evaluator is
registered as the `integrand_v` C callback
(`int(unsigned ndim, size_t npt, const double *x, void *fdata, unsigned fdim, double *fval)`).
**Reimplementing the adaptive subdivision algorithm was rejected outright**:
region-splitting decisions depend on an FP-summation-order-sensitive error
estimate exactly like the RK45 step controller (§2.2) — a reimplementation
would face the same adaptive-path divergence that took real debugging effort
in Phases 1-2 (TESTING.md §3), except cubature has no `max_dt=min_dt` escape
hatch to pin node placement. Binding the same library makes node placement
bit-identical by construction instead of merely close.

**Scope implemented — narrow on purpose, mirrors the Phase 3/4 pattern:**
- **RealGrid only**, `full=false` only (the default — `Cubature.pcubature_v`,
  a 1-D radial integral; Julia's `pointcalc!` fixes `θ=0` in this branch, since
  the azimuthal dependence is folded into the analytic mode-field formula, not
  integrated numerically). `full=true` (`hcubature_v`, genuine 2-D `(r,θ)`
  integral) is deferred.
- **`MarcatiliMode`, `kind=:HE`, `n=1` only** (the `HE1m` family —
  `HE11`, `HE12`, …, the mode basis used throughout Luna's capillary examples
  and tests). Field formula needs only `besselj(0,·)` and `besselj(1,·)`
  (`src/Capillary.jl:271-288`), which `diffraction.rs`'s existing `j0`/`j1`
  already provide — **verified against Julia `SpecialFunctions.besselj` over
  `x∈[0,6]` (covers `u₀₁≈2.405`, `u₀₂≈5.520`): max absolute error ~1.5e-15**
  (the ~1e-11 *relative* error right at a Bessel zero is an artifact of
  dividing by a near-zero value, not a precision problem — the field itself is
  correctly ~0 there by construction, the boundary condition the zero encodes).
  General `n` (needed for `TE`/`TM` and `HE_{n>1,m}` modes) needs a proper
  general-order Bessel routine (Miller's backward recurrence — the naive
  upward recurrence is unstable for `x<n`) and is deferred; the native guard
  rejects any mode with `n≠1` or `kind≠:HE` and falls back to Julia.
- **Constant radius only** (`MarcatiliMode{<:Number,...}`, i.e. `m.a` is a
  plain number, not a z-dependent closure `m.a(z)` for a tapered capillary).
  Reject/fall back otherwise.
- **Normalization precomputed in Julia, not ported.** `MarcatiliMode` overrides
  the generic (numerically-integrated) `Modes.N` with a **closed form**:
  `N(m,z) = π/2 · a(z)² · besselj(n, unm)² · √(ε₀/μ₀)` (`src/Capillary.jl:285-288`).
  For a constant-radius mode this is a single z-invariant scalar. Julia
  precomputes `1/√N` per mode once and passes it over FFI alongside `unm`,
  `a`, `n`, `φ` — **no `besselj` call happens in Rust for normalization**, only
  for the per-node field synthesis (`besselj(n-1, r·unm/a)`, i.e. `j0` for
  `n=1`).
- **Kerr-only nonlinearity, `npol=1` gated in — `npol=2` implemented but not
  yet verified, gated off.** `rhs_modal_pointcalc` reuses the exact
  `KerrScalar!` (`npol=1`, `E³`) / `KerrVector!` (`npol=2`,
  `(Ex²+Ey²)·(Ex,Ey)`, `src/Nonlinear.jl:81-93`) formulas already ported for
  Phase 1/3. The Julia wiring in `RK45.jl` `error()`s on `npol≠1` — the
  `KerrVector!` code path exists in `native.rs` but the shipped gate test
  only exercises `npol=1` (`components=:y`, the default for
  `polarisation=:linear/:x/:y`); a `npol=2` test needs real energy in
  **both** polarisation components (circular/elliptical, not just `:xy`
  components with a degenerate y-only input, which would leave the
  `Ex²`-cross-term untested) to genuinely check the coupling term, and that
  hasn't been done — do not remove this gate without adding that test first.
  Raman and plasma are **deferred for complexity, not because they are physically
  ill-defined at cubature nodes** — per-node Raman is exactly as well-formed
  as Phase 4's per-column Raman (the ADE solver resets its state every RHS
  call from the current time-domain field, `solve_scalar`; it has no memory
  across z-steps or across spatial location, so a moving cubature node is not
  a problem). A future phase can add it as one more additive `Et_to_Pt!` term,
  exactly as Phase 4 added it to `rhs_mode_avg_real`.
- **`shotnoise=false`** (`Emω_noise = nothing`) — the modified shot-noise
  branch (`Er_noise`/`Er_nl`) is not ported.
- **Any other mode type (`DelegatedMode`, interpolated/numeric modes, or a
  mode tuple mixing an ineligible mode with eligible ones) is a hard
  fallback to Julia, not a deferred scope item** — those modes are arbitrary
  Julia closures with no Rust-portable representation at all (unlike the
  scope items above, which are "not yet ported").

**Multi-mode projection is exercised by the first-cut test, not skipped.**
The gate test uses two co-eligible modes (`HE11` + `HE12`, both `n=1`, both
`j0`-based, different `unm`) specifically so the `to_space!` sum-over-modes
matmul and the back-projection matmul (`Prω · transpose(Ems)`) are genuinely
tested with `nmodes=2`, not left implicitly untested by a single-mode
shortcut. Self-validating per the Phase 4 lesson: the full-solve testset
independently asserts the Kerr-driven HE11→HE12 energy transfer is
non-negligible (2.0e-5 of total energy, far above any noise floor) before
trusting the Rust-vs-Julia comparison — a passing comparison where both
paths trivially stay in mode 1 would prove nothing about the two matmuls.

**Gate achieved:** single-step 1.4e-19 (looser ~1e-10 tier documented below
was the conservative target; the dominant single-step error source, `j0`'s
~1e-15 absolute agreement with `SpecialFunctions.besselj`, turned out not to
be the limiting factor at this problem size), full-solve 4.0e-16 (fixed step
size, `test/test_native_modal.jl`). The looser tier is still worth stating
explicitly for future phases: node placement is bit-identical (same
`libcubature` binary) but mode-field synthesis is not bit-for-bit against
`SpecialFunctions.besselj`, so ~1e-10 (not ~1e-13) is the *documented*
ceiling even though this run landed far under it.

### 3.4 Free-space — `TransFree` (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:826`) — Phase 6, ported
2-D Cartesian spatial axis: a genuine **3-D FFT** over `(t,y,x)` jointly
(`FFTW.plan_rfft(x, (1,2,3))`, `src/Luna.jl:295` — all three axes transformed
together, unlike Phase 3's radial QDHT-plus-1-D-FFT). Per RHS
(`TransFree.__call__`, `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:818-838`):
```
copy_scale!(Eωo, Eωk, N, scale)     # zero-pad ω → oversampled, per (y,x) column
ldiv!(Eto, FT, Eωo)                 # (ω,ky,kx) → (t,y,x), ONE joint 3-D transform
Et_to_Pt!(Pto, Eto, resp, ρ, idcs)  # Kerr, plus per-column plasma if present
Pto .*= towin                       # per t, broadcast over (y,x)
mul!(Pωo, FT, Pto)                  # (t,y,x) → (ω,ky,kx), ONE joint 3-D transform
copy_scale!(nl, Pωo, N, 1/scale)    # truncate oversampled → base, per (y,x) column
nl .*= ωwin .* (-im·ω) ./ (2 .* normfun(z))
```

**Reuse, don't reinvent — same FFTW binary, one new plan-creation call.**
`fftw.rs` already `dlopen`s the identical libfftw3 Julia's `FFTW.jl` uses
(ARCHITECTURE §4.1); the *execute* entry points (`fftw_execute_dft_r2c`/
`_c2r`) are rank-agnostic — they work on a 3-D plan exactly as on the
existing 1-D plans. The only new surface is **plan creation**:
`fftw_plan_dft_r2c_3d`/`fftw_plan_dft_c2r_3d` (`RealFft3d` in `fftw.rs`).
This is much lower-risk than Phase 5's cubature situation (a genuinely new
library) — it is the *same* binary, just a rank-3 plan instead of rank-1.

**Dimension order and normalization were measured, not assumed, before
being trusted.** Julia's buffers are column-major `(n_t, n_y, n_x)` (`n_t`
fastest-varying); FFTW's basic-interface dimension list is given
slowest→fastest, so `RealFft3d::new` passes `(n_x, n_y, n_t)` — **reversed**
— to align FFTW's fastest dimension with Julia's `n_t` axis. This is the
same reversal rule that makes 1-D bit-parity trivial, but for rank 3 it is
easy to get subtly wrong (and a Rust-only forward+inverse round-trip test
*cannot* catch a transposed-axis bug — it would still round-trip correctly
against itself). Verified instead with a literal cross-check against
`FFTW.rfft(reshape(Float64.(1:24),4,3,2), (1,2,3))` computed independently in
Julia (`fftw.rs::tests::r2c_3d_matches_julia_reference`) — confirms both the
dimension order **and** which axis gets conjugate-symmetric-halved (`n_t`,
matching Julia's `size(rfft(x,(1,2,3))) == (n_t÷2+1, n_y, n_x)`).

**The round-trip normalization factor is `1/(n_t·n_y·n_x)`, not `1/n_t`** —
easy to get wrong by copying the 1-D convention, since the transform now
spans all three axes rather than just the time axis. Confirmed by the same
literal test.

**Multi-dimensional c2r destroys its input.** Unlike 1-D c2r (which supports
`FFTW_PRESERVE_INPUT`, used by `RealFft1d`), FFTW does not support
`PRESERVE_INPUT` for rank>1 c2r plans. `rhs_free` follows the same
copy-into-scratch-before-inverse structure every other native RHS already
uses (Phase 1/3's `eoo`/`radial_eoo` scratch buffers), so this is harmless
by construction, not a new precaution.

**No per-column spatial step, unlike radial.** Because the FFT is a single
joint 3-D transform (not a 1-D transform looped over a separate QDHT-style
spatial step), the Kerr response and the final normalization multiply are
**plain flat elementwise operations over the whole `(t,y,x)`/`(ω,ky,kx)`
volume** — no column-dependent logic at all (Kerr's `E³` formula and the
precomputed `M` array are identical at every spatial point). Only the
zero-pad/truncate (`copy_scale!`) and `towin` apodization steps need an
explicit per-`(y,x)`-column loop, since those act along the `t`/`ω` axis
specifically. This makes `rhs_free` mechanically simpler than `rhs_radial`
once the FFT primitive itself is trusted.

**Normalization precomputed as one flat complex array, same pattern as
Phase 3's `M`.** `ωwin[iω]·(-i·ω[iω])/(2·normfun(z)[iω,iky,ikx])` is
precomputed once in Julia (valid only for a z-invariant `normfun`, i.e.
`const_norm_free` — the same constant-medium restriction every other phase
carries) and passed as one flat `(n_spec, n_y, n_x)` array; `rhs_free` does
one elementwise multiply, needing zero of `norm_free`'s `k_z`/evanescent
masking logic ported.

**Scope implemented:** RealGrid + `const_norm_free` (z-invariant normfun)
scalar Kerr and EnvGrid + `const_norm_free` scalar Kerr, reusing the exact
`E³`/`|E|²E` formulas already ported. The modified shot-noise branch
(`Et_noise`/`Et_nl`) is **not** ported (`shotnoise=false` required), and a
z-dependent `normfun` remains deferred. EnvGrid uses the full-spectrum c2c
3-D path: preserve low/high halves, apply `1/(n_t·n_y·n_x)` inverse scaling,
evaluate `Kerr_env`, window, forward-transform, crop, and normalize.

Plan 19 extends only the RealGrid branch with one PPT plasma response. After
the inverse transform and Kerr, the flattened volume is segmented into
`n_y*n_x` independent time series. For each series, CUDA applies the same
three trapezoidal integrations and current add-in as the CPU
`apply_plasma_free`: PPT rate → ionized fraction → `e_ratio*F*E` phase →
ionization-loss current → polarization, then adds `density*P` into `Pto`.
The segmented block totals are indexed by `(series, block)`, so a partial
last block or adjacent spatial columns cannot share prefix state. This
plasma contribution is applied before `towin` and the joint forward FFT;
EnvGrid plasma, ADK, Raman, z-dependent normalization, and shot noise remain
outside the CUDA contract.

Plan 20 uses the same free-space RealGrid series layout and three cumulative
trapezoid stages for thresholded ADK. Only the pointwise rate changes: each
sample uses `IonRateADK`'s exact finite-field threshold branch and the seven
Julia-transferred constants, including the optional `avfac*sqrt(abs(E))`
factor. The resulting ADK polarization is accumulated after Kerr and before
the time window and joint forward transform; unthresholded ADK remains on the
CPU path.

Plan 21 reuses that same flattened layout for delayed SDO Raman: `s=iy+n_y*ix`
and `j=s*n_time_over+i`, with one ADE oscillator-state vector per spatial
series. For `thg=true`, the intensity input is `E²`; for `thg=false`, a batched
temporal-only c2c transform applies the local analytic-signal mask before
forming `0.5*abs2(hilbert(E))`. The ADE output is then accumulated as
`Pto += density*E*P`, after Kerr and before the time window and joint forward
3-D transform. Scratch allocation and the Hilbert plan use checked
`n_time_over*n_y*n_x` sizing, and the setter commits only after all new device
buffers/plans are ready. This is why a non-square grid with independent point
signals is part of the acceptance test: a flattened-series or Hilbert-axis
mistake can otherwise agree on a symmetric pulse.

**Plan 21 gate:** strict CUDA direct-stage errors were `1.28e-15`–`1.35e-15`
and fixed-solve errors were `2.62e-16`/`2.68e-16` for `thg=true/false`; the
Julia Raman-on/off effects were `1.176e-3`/`1.181e-3`, comfortably above the
`1e-6` trajectory tolerance. The focused item passed 44/44, including N₂
vibration, rotation, rotation+vibration, rejection boundaries, and a rejected
adaptive step. EnvGrid Raman, plasma composition, z-dependent norm/linop, and
automatic dispatch remain outside this contract.

**Gate achieved:** single-step 7.05e-18, full-solve 5.01e-17 (fixed step
size, `test/test_native_free.jl`, `N=8` transverse grid). Both land at the
same clean FFTW-parity floor as Phase 1/2 (no QDHT-style intermediate
summation-order floor, since there is no separate spatial transform step) —
consistent with the dimension-order/normalization risk being fully retired
at the FFT-primitive level (`fftw.rs`'s literal cross-check) rather than
showing up as residual noise in the RHS.

### 3.5 z-dependent linear operator — mode-averaged pressure-gradient capillary, Phase 7, ported (narrow scope)

Phases 1–6 all require `L(ω)` to be **constant in z** (`make_const_linop`):
built once in Julia, copied into `NativeSim.linop`, applied via
`exp(linop·Δt)`. Phase 7 is the first to support `L(ω,z)` resident, for one
concrete, common case: a **pressure-gradient (tapered-fill) capillary**,
`Interface.jl:532-541` → `Capillary.gradient(gas, L, p0, p1)` → a graded-core,
**constant-radius** `MarcatiliMode`. This is the "tapered fiber, pressure
gradient" case flagged as the motivating use in the Phase 6 handoff notes.
Scope restrictions (mirrors every prior phase's narrowing discipline):
mode-averaged (`TransModeAvg`) only, RealGrid only, single non-vector mode,
`kind`/`n`/`model`/`loss` unrestricted (both work — see below), Kerr-only.
Radial/free-space/modal z-dependent `nfun` (arbitrary index profile, not
just a graded-core gas fill) is deferred — narrower but real, matching the
existing wired path (`Interface.jl`'s pressure-tuple branch), not invented.

**The physics is separable in `(ω, z)` — this is the whole design.**
`LinearOps.jl:279-296`'s z-dependent `linop!(out,z)` (mode-averaged case)
needs, at each requested `z`:
```
εco(ω;z) = coren(ω;z)² = 1 + γ(λ(ω))·dens(z)        # Capillary.gradient, :302-341
nwg(ω)                                                # z-independent for constant radius
neff(ω;z) = combine(εco(ω;z), nwg(ω); model)          # sqrt(εco-nwg) or 1+(εco-1)/2-nwg
nc(ω;z)   = conj_clamp(neff(ω;z), ω)                  # LinearOps.jl:246
β1(z)     = Modes.dispersion(mode, 1, ω0; z=z)        # Maths.derivative — adaptive FD
out[iω]   = -i·(ω[iω]/c·nc(ω[iω];z) - ω[iω]·β1(z))    # LinearOps.jl:307
```
`γ(λ)` is the gas's Sellmeier susceptibility-per-density coefficient
(`PhysData.sellmeier_gas`, a *real* function of wavelength only — no
z-dependence at all) and `dens(z)` is the density profile
(`dspl(p(z))`, a cubic spline of pressure over a closed-form or piecewise
pressure ramp). **Critically, `εco(ω;z) - 1` factors as a fixed per-ω array
(`γ(λ(ω))`) times a scalar function of z (`dens(z)`)** — the ω-dependence
and z-dependence never mix. This means:
- `nwg(ω)` is **exactly** the already-resident combine from the existing
  `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION` wiring (`dispersion.rs::MarcatiliNeff::neff_vector`,
  `Capillary.jl:409-470`) — not re-derived, just re-implemented inline in
  `native.rs` (the opaque handle itself isn't shared with `NativeSim`, but
  the formula — `sqrt(εco-nwg)`/`1+(εco-1)/2-nwg`, then truncate `Im` if
  `!loss` — is copied verbatim from `neff_vector`, which already documents
  "no clamping here" i.e. `conj_clamp` is applied by the *caller*, exactly
  matching where it's applied here too).
- The only two z-dependent quantities the resident stepper needs are
  **scalars**: `dens(z)` and `β1(z)`. Neither needs an O(n_ω) Julia
  round-trip per stage — each is a single number.

**`β1(z)` is an exact closed form, not a LUT — see `BETA1_ANALYTIC.md`.**
`dens(pressure)` is transferred exactly from `PhysData.densityspline`'s own
`(x,y,D)` (a `HermiteSpline` reproducing Julia's `Maths.CSpline` formula
bit-for-bit — re-fitting a *different* spline through sampled `dens` values
was tried first and does not converge, see the postmortem in `PORT_LOG.md`).
`β1(z) = d/dω[ω/c·Re(neff(ω,z))]|_{ω0}` does not need a LUT at all: since
`εco(ω;z)-1 = γ(λ(ω))·dens(z)` is separable and `nwg(ω)` is z-independent,
the chain rule collapses β1(z) to a function of the single scalar `dens(z)`
given 4 z-independent constants (`γ0`, `dγ0`, `nwg0`, `dnwg0`) computed once
at setup. These are computed via `Maths.derivative` fed a `BigFloat`
argument rather than hand-derived symbolically (the gas/glass Sellmeier
closures are opaque — arbitrary materials, not hardcoded coefficients) —
see `BETA1_ANALYTIC.md` for the full derivation, why an earlier `(dens,β1)`
LUT design was replaced, and the resulting tolerance tradeoff (Rust's β1 is
now more accurate than Julia's own adaptive-FD `dispersion`, which means
Rust *deliberately* diverges from the Julia oracle by Julia's own FD error,
amplified over propagation length and bandwidth into the full-solve
tolerance floor below).

**Boundary behavior must match Julia's flat clamp, not spline extrapolation.**
`Capillary.gradient`'s `p(z)` is flat outside `[0,L]`
(`z > L ? p1 : z <= 0 ? p0 : sqrt(...)`, `Capillary.jl:310-312`), and the
adaptive stepper's final accepted step can legitimately evaluate the linop
at a `z` slightly past `flength` (the `while s.tn <= tmax` loop in
`RK45.solve` checks *before* stepping, so the step that crosses `tmax` still
executes). Both LUTs therefore **clamp their query `z` into `[0, flength]`
before the spline lookup** (`z.clamp(0.0, flength)`), exactly reproducing
Julia's flat boundary behavior instead of letting the natural-spline BC
extrapolate/oscillate past the fitted domain — a held-out test point at and
beyond both boundaries is part of the equivalence test, not just interior
points (an all-interior held-out check would be blind to exactly this, the
same way Phase 6's square-grid test was blind to the axis-swap bug).

**`prop!`'s per-stage recompute, not a new call site.** Rust already applies
`exp(linop·Δt)` at 5 call sites per `native_step` (the FSAL re-frame, the
3 forward/backward pairs per RK stage, and the final propagate-to-`tn`) —
see `native.rs::native_step`. Every one of Julia's `prop!(y,t1,t2,bwd)`
calls evaluates `linop!` at `t2` **regardless of `bwd`** (`LinearOps.jl:306-311`,
memoized so a repeated `t2` is a no-op) — i.e. a forward/backward pair
always shares one `linop` evaluation. Phase 7 mirrors this with
`NativeSim::ensure_linop_at(z)`, which overwrites the (now no-longer-const)
`self.linop` buffer in place only when the requested `z` differs from the
last one cached, and is a no-op entirely when the mode is not the
z-dependent case (Phases 1-6 unaffected, zero cost). This keeps every
existing `apply_prop(y, &s.linop, dt)` call site unchanged; only a
`s.ensure_linop_at(z_eval)` call is inserted immediately before each one.

**Scope not ported:** `EnvGrid` (β0-reference-frame variant of the same
formula, `LinearOps.jl:353-380`), radial/free-space/modal z-dependent
`nfun` (arbitrary index profile — the separable-in-`(ω,z)` structure this
design leans on is specific to a graded-core gas fill, not a general
`nfun(ω;z)`), multi-mode (`make_linop(grid,modes,λ0)`, tapered-radius
`MarcatiliMode{<:Function}`), and plasma/Raman-in-z-dependent-linop (Kerr
only, consistent with every prior phase).

**The nonlinear RHS also needs the z-dependence, not just the linop.**
`TransModeAvg`'s `(t::TransModeAvg)(nl,Eω,z)` (`NonlinearRHS.jl:531-545`)
calls `t.densityfun(z)` fresh every RK stage, and `norm_mode_average`'s
`norm!(nl,z)` (`NonlinearRHS.jl:553-565`) calls `βfun!(β,z)` fresh every
stage too — both genuinely vary across a pressure gradient. Phases 1-6's
constant-medium `native_set_mode_avg_params` instead bakes `kerr_fac =
density(0)·ε₀·γ3` and `beta[i] = β(ω_i;0)` in **once**, at construction —
correct there (medium never changes), wrong for Phase 7 as originally
wired. `ensure_linop_at` now also rescales `kerr_fac` by the just-computed
`dens(z)` and overwrites `beta[i]` with `ω_i/c·Re(neff(ω_i,z))` (reusing the
per-ω `neff` already computed for the linop) every call. Missing this was
the actual cause of a ~9% full-solve mismatch during development — traced
by isolating that the z-dependent linop alone already matched Julia to
~1e-8 (via `native_debug_linop_at`), and that a `kerr=false` (pure linear)
full-solve run matched Julia to the same ~1e-8, while `kerr=true` did not:
the divergence had to be in the RHS, not the linear propagator. See
`PORT_LOG.md`'s Phase 7 postmortem.

**Expected tolerance floor.** `dens(z)` is transferred exactly (no LUT, no
interpolation error), and `β1(z)`'s analytic closed form matches Julia's own
`Modes.dispersion` (an adaptive finite difference) to ~1e-11–1e-12 relative
— see `BETA1_ANALYTIC.md`. This is *smaller* than Phases 1-6's floors, but
it is a **systematic**, not random, difference from the Julia oracle (Rust
computes the true derivative; Julia's FD has its own small, repeatable
truncation error), so it accumulates coherently over the full propagation
length and spectral bandwidth rather than averaging out. For a broadband
run (λlims spanning 200nm-4000nm, 0.5m gradient) this measured as ~1e-6 in
the point-wise linop and ~1e-4 in a fixed-step full-solve — both confirmed
(via a `kerr=false` control run showing the *same* magnitude) to be entirely
this β1 method difference, not a bug. Narrower-bandwidth or shorter runs
will show a proportionally smaller floor. Do not chase this number down by
reverting to a Julia-value-reproducing LUT — that trades "Rust is exact"
for "Rust matches Julia's imprecision," which is not what Phase 7 is for.

## 4. FFT conventions (must match FFTW.jl exactly)

| Grid | forward (t→ω) | inverse (ω→t) | length |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| RealGrid | `rfft` | `irfft` | `Nt → Nt÷2+1` |
| EnvGrid | `fft` | `ifft` | `Nt → Nt` |

- Normalization is applied explicitly via `copy_scale!` / the `prefactor`, **not**
  folded into the plan. The native side must apply the same scalar at the same
  point so rounding matches.
- The **oversampled grid** `FTo` (`grid.FTo`, larger `Nt`) is used for the
  time-domain product to avoid aliasing of the cubic Kerr term; the native RHS
  needs a second pair of plans for it and the same zero-pad/truncate convention.
- Binding the **same FFTW library** (ARCHITECTURE §4.1) is what makes these
  transforms bit-identical rather than merely close.

## 5. Response functions (time/space domain, step 2)

All live in `src/Nonlinear.jl`. The native port reproduces each in Rust.

### 5.1 Kerr (`src/Nonlinear.jl:81-157`)
Instantaneous χ⁽³⁾. Variants: scalar `E³`; vectorial (polarization-resolved);
third-harmonic (`thg`) vs. Hilbert-envelope (no-thg) forms. For EnvGrid a
`Kerr_env` variant uses `|E|²E`. Coefficient: `χ₃ · ε₀` folded into one scalar.
**Gotcha (bit us in Phase 2a):** `Kerr_env` carries an extra **3/4 SVEA
prefactor** vs. the carrier-resolved (no-thg) form — `rhs_mode_avg_env` must
multiply `kerr_fac` by `0.75`. Missing this passed compilation but showed up
as a single-step error of ~9.5e-6 (not machine epsilon), not a crash.

### 5.2 Plasma — `PlasmaCumtrapz` (`src/Nonlinear.jl:161-250`) — Phase 2, ported
The expensive nonlinearity. Per RHS:
1. ionization rate `W(|E|)` from the PPT LUT (already Rust, `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION`);
2. **three cumulative trapezoidal integrals** (`cumtrapz`): free-electron density
   `ρ(t)` from the rate; the loss/heating current; the polarization current;
3. assemble the plasma current `J(t)` and add to `Pt`.
Ported in Phase 2 as `rhs_plasma` (`amalthea/src/native.rs`,
`cumtrapz_slice_f64` + `native_set_plasma_params`). Since Phase C, native
construction creates the required ionization handle whenever the resident
backend is enabled; the older per-kernel `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION`
toggle no longer decides whether the default native workload is eligible.

### 5.3 Raman (`src/Nonlinear.jl:357-431`) — Phase 4, ported
Delayed χ⁽³⁾. The carrier-field SDO path (`RamanPolarField`) is already Rust
(`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`): a single-damped-oscillator ADE stepped by an exact
exponential integrator (`x_{n+1} = A·x_n + B0·Iₙ + B1·I_{n+1}`), O(Nt) and
allocation-free, vs. Julia's FFT convolution. Phase 4 makes that solver resident
in the RHS. The envelope path (`RamanPolarEnv`) and intermediate-broadening
(Gaussian-damped) responses stay Julia. *(Update: both later went native —
`RamanPolarEnv` in Phase F item 2, intermediate-broadening as a second
resident FFT-convolution kernel in Phase I item 2 (2026-07-08,
`native_set_raman_fft_params` / `rhs_mode_avg_env` Step 3c) — see
BACKLOG.md. This section's remaining text describes the Phase 4 SDO/ADE
kernel only.)*

**Reuse, don't reinvent — same pattern as Phase 3's QDHT.** `raman.rs`'s
`TimeDomainRamanSolver` is already a self-contained, public Rust struct
(`new`, `reset_state`, `solve`) — the existing `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN` FFI
wiring is a thin `ccall` wrapper around it. `NativeSim` stores one directly
(`Option<TimeDomainRamanSolver>`), built once in a new
`native_set_raman_params` from the same `omega`/`gamma`/`coupling` arrays
Julia already extracts in `Interface._make_rust_raman_handle_from_response`
(`Ω`, `1/τ2ρ(1.0)`, `K` per `RamanRespSingleDampedOscillator`). `solve()`
resets its internal oscillator state at the start of every call
(`solve_scalar`, `raman.rs`), so it is safe to call once per RHS evaluation
exactly like Kerr/plasma — no state carries between RK stages, matching the
Julia FFT-convolution semantics it replaces (each RHS call recomputes the
full convolution over the current trial field, not an incremental
step-to-step integration).

The 2026-08-24 CPU implementation stores `q`, `dq`, and the eight entries of
`A/B0/B1` in separate vectors. AVX2 advances four oscillators and AArch64 NEON
advances two; scalar tails cover every oscillator count. No SIMD horizontal
reduction forms the polarization: updated `q` lanes are added to the total in
their original oscillator order. This preserves the scalar recurrence's
observable accumulation order while vectorizing the state transition.

**Additive, not a replacement RHS.** Raman is just another entry in
`TransModeAvg`'s `resp` tuple, called after Kerr in `Et_to_Pt!` and
accumulated into the same `Pt` buffer — `resp!(Pt, Et, density)` for each
response, `fill!(Pt,0)` once at the start. So `rhs_mode_avg_real` gains one
more additive step after the existing Kerr (and optional plasma) step,
computed from the *same* time-domain field buffer (`self.eto`) already in
hand — no new to_time!/to_freq! transform needed:
```
intensity[i] = Eto[i]²                      # thg=true: sqr!(R, E) = E.^2
raman_solver.solve(intensity, raman_p)      # resets state, then ADE-integrates
Pto[i] += ρ · Eto[i] · raman_p[i]            # matches Pout[i]=ρ*E[i]*R.P[i]
```
`ρ` is the same constant-medium density (`f!.densityfun(0.0)`) already used
for Kerr's `kerr_fac` — stored separately (unscaled by `ε₀·γ3`) since Raman's
accumulation formula needs the raw density, not the Kerr-folded constant.

**Scope: `thg=true` only** (the default, and the common case — `E²`
intensity, no Hilbert transform). `thg=false` computes intensity via
`1/2·|hilbert(E)|²` (`Kerr_field_nothg`'s sibling path, `sqr!` in
Nonlinear.jl:342-349) — porting the Hilbert transform to Rust is a separate
piece of work, deferred as a follow-up alongside `RamanPolarEnv` and
intermediate-broadening (Gaussian-damped) responses, none of which are in
this phase's scope.

**Eligibility mirrors the existing `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN` wiring exactly**
(`Interface._make_rust_raman_handle_from_response`, `src/Interface.jl:581`):
`CombinedRamanResponse` whose `Rs` are all `RamanRespSingleDampedOscillator`,
with density-independent `τ2ρ`. Molecular gases (`:N2`, `:H2`, `:D2`, `:N2O`,
`:CH4`, `:SF6`) auto-enable Raman by default in `makeresponse`
(`src/Interface.jl:608`). N2's vibrational line qualifies (constant
`τ2v=6e-12`); its rotational line (`RamanRespRotationalNonRigid`, a
multi-line comb) does not — use `rotation=false, vibration=true` for a
clean single-oscillator test case. H2's vibrational line is *not* eligible
(`Bρv`/`Aρv` make `τ2ρ` density-dependent) — useful as a negative control.

**Gate-test pitfall (found during Phase 4 validation, see PORT_LOG
2026-07-01): verify the feature under test actually changes the reference
result before trusting a passing equivalence assertion.** At the parameters
first tried (N2, 1 atm, 1 μJ, 30 fs, one 1cm z-step), Raman-on vs Raman-off
gave an *exact* `0.0` difference in the Julia oracle alone — not close to
zero, identically zero — because Raman's raw per-step RHS contribution is
~2e-16 relative to Kerr's (at the double-precision floor) for a single small
step; the effect only becomes measurable (1.1e-4 over 5cm/6 fixed steps) once
compounded through the propagation's nonlinear dynamics. A test comparing two
implementations that both silently omit the same feature passes for the
wrong reason. The full-solve testset therefore asserts, in order: (1) Raman
changes the Julia oracle's result by a margin unmistakably above the FP
floor, *then* (2) Rust matches Julia on that changed result. Apply the same
two-part structure to any future feature whose per-step effect might be
small relative to the dominant nonlinearity.

## 6. Linear operator `L(ω, z)` (Phase 7, ported — narrow scope, see §3.5)

`L` is built in `src/LinearOps.jl`:
- **Constant** (`make_const_linop`): z-independent; built once at setup, copied
  into `NativeSim` as a flat array. Phases 1–6 use this path — cheap, left on
  Julia for assembly, applied in Rust.
- **z-dependent** (`make_linop`): rebuilt per step (e.g. changing gas
  pressure, bending). Phase 7 ports the mode-averaged, graded-core
  constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` case (`LinearOps.jl:279-296`) resident —
  see §3.5 for the full design (separable `εco(ω;z)`, LUT'd `dens(z)`/`β1(z)`,
  boundary-clamp discipline). Radial/free-space/modal `make_linop` (arbitrary
  `nfun(ω;z)`, `LinearOps.jl:77,185,337`) and multi-mode are deferred.

`L` includes: the propagation constant β(ω) (from the Rust dispersion kernels),
the loss `α(ω)/2`, and the subtraction of the reference `β₀ + β₁·(ω-ω₀)` that
defines the co-moving frame.

## 7. QDHT normalization caveat (already resolved, preserve in port)

Julia's `Hankel.QDHT` and the Rust `Qdht` use **different T-matrix
normalizations**. The wired path resolves this by passing **Julia's T matrix**
into Rust (transposed to row-major at `init_qdht_ffi`) and using that exact
bit-pattern at runtime — agreement ~1e-13 (BLAS vs. sequential summation order).
The resident-QDHT port (Phase 3) must keep using Julia's T matrix, **not**
recompute T from the Rust convention, or the normalization will silently differ.

## 8. Beyond-Luna math options (2026-07-08 audit — outcomes updated 2026-07-25)

The port has already crossed the "better than the oracle" line
deliberately in a few places: the analytic β1 closed form
(BETA1_ANALYTIC.md) replacing Julia's adaptive-FD noise, Chebyshev-
recurrence dispersion, the O(Nt) ADE Raman integrator replacing
O(Nt·logNt) FFT convolution, and exact Gauss-Legendre integrating
factors. The options below were audited under that standard. Two were
rejected after their premises were checked, two landed without changing
the physics, and the last was benchmarked and rejected. Durable
feasibility detail is in `PLANS.md` §6; live status is in `BACKLOG.md`.

### 8.1 Direct embedded-error coefficients (SUGGESTIONS.md #15)
**Outcome: do not pursue.** Both Julia and Rust already precompute
`errest = b5-b4`; there is no runtime subtraction of two completed
solutions to remove. The remaining sensitivity is summation-order
cancellation in `Σ errestᵢkᵢ`, which this proposal would not change.

The original proposal assumed the implementations formed `y5-y4` at
runtime. Source tracing found both instead evaluate
`err = Σᵢ errestᵢ·kᵢ` with `errest = b5-b4` precomputed at load/compile
time. Replacing those constants with the same exact differences cannot
change the cancellation that occurs while summing weak stage derivatives.

### 8.2 Direct PPT evaluation (SUGGESTIONS.md #16)
**Outcome: do not pursue.** The true PPT series includes a
BigFloat-quadrature tail unsuitable for the hot loop, while the LUT error is
already below physical significance. The out-of-range/non-finite crash
motivation was independently fixed by hardening the LUT/rate guards.

Julia's `IonRatePPTAccel` is itself a spline LUT over the true PPT
series, and the Rust port matched it LUT-for-LUT (parity, per the
port's rules). But the PPT rate can be evaluated directly with good
special-function code — more accurate than *both* current paths, the
same move as β1. It also structurally eliminates the out-of-range
segfault (BACKLOG Phase J item 2): a closed-form evaluation has no
fitted range to fall off of. Verification target: the direct sum
against a BigFloat evaluation of the same series, then the sim-level
triangulating tests unchanged.

### 8.3 5th-order dense output (SUGGESTIONS.md #12, already tracked)
**Outcome: complete 2026-07-23.** Both sides use the same order-5
extra-stage extension; the same work fixed the eager FSAL carry that had
reduced dense output to first order.

### 8.4 r2c halving of the FFT-conv Raman (BACKLOG Phase J item 3)
**Outcome: complete 2026-07-22.** Both the native `:SiO2` kernel and Julia
`RamanPolarEnv` moved together; measured speedup was 1.8–2.8×.

The padded E² and h are mathematically real in both Raman convolution
paths; Julia's `RamanPolarEnv` nonetheless uses a full c2c `plan_fft`
(Nonlinear.jl:327) and the native SiO2 kernel mirrors it for parity. A
Hermitian r2c/c2r pair computes the identical convolution at half the
transform cost. Same answer, different summation order → fixed-step
validation discipline.

### 8.5 Short-kernel (overlap-save) Raman convolution (SUGGESTIONS.md #17)
**Outcome: measured 2026-07-25; do not pursue.** The design premise was
wrong for the implemented Hollenbeck & Cantrell response: its support at an
f64-noise cutoff is about 4.15 ps, or 76-86% of `n_time_over`, not about
100 fs / 5-10% of the padded grid. At the repository's real
`n_time_over=4096` configuration, the natural mixed-radix transform length
made the isolated candidate slightly slower (0.98×); projected end-to-end
speedup was only about 0.99-1.05×, below the >1.4× gate. Truncation accuracy
was already sufficient (1.7e-16-3.4e-14), so this is a performance rejection,
not a correctness blocker. The benchmark/prototype was reverted; see
`BACKLOG.md` queue item 5 and `PLANS.md` §6.3.
