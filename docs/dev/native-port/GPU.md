# GPU-Resident Propagation (Track S3) Design Document

> **Current status (2026-08-08, updated): the correctness block is FIXED.**

> **2026-08-08 Plan 16:** modal RealGrid scalar `npol=1` now supports one
> flattenable SDO `RamanPolarField` alongside Kerr. Each callback batch owns

> **2026-08-08 Plan 17:** free-space RealGrid scalar Kerr now has a
> transactional CUDA setup with independent 3-D D2Z/Z2D plans and resident
> `(t,y,x)` scratch. cuFFT receives `(n_x,n_y,n_time)` so the halved dimension

> **2026-08-08 Plan 18:** the same free-space resident pipeline now supports
> EnvGrid scalar Kerr with full-spectrum complex scratch and a joint 3-D Z2Z

> remain excluded.

> **2026-08-08 Plan 19:** free-space RealGrid now supports one scalar Kerr

> `n_y*n_x`-sized rate/fraction/current/polarization scratch and no prefix
> carry across spatial columns. Plasma is accumulated before the time window
> and joint forward 3-D transform. Strict hardware verification passed
> 28/28 on a non-square `10×8` grid: direct/asymmetric stage error was
> `1.3e-15`, fixed-solve error `5.0e-16`, adaptive error `1.3e-14`, and the
> independently measured Julia plasma share was `1.57e-6`. EnvGrid plasma,
> ADK, Raman, z-dependent norm/linop, and `:auto` remain excluded.

> **2026-08-08 Plan 20:** free-space RealGrid now also supports one thresholded
> ADK plasma response. It reuses Plan 19's independent segmented scans over
> every `(y,x)` time series, but launches the exact pointwise ADK rate with
> threshold and non-finite-field semantics matching Julia. Strict focused
> hardware verification passed 43/43: direct stage errors were `1.2e-15` and
> `1.3e-15`, fixed-solve error was `4.8e-16`, adaptive error was `1.4e-16`,
> and the Julia ADK effect was `2.7e-3`. Unthresholded ADK, EnvGrid plasma,
> Raman/noise, z-dependent norm/linop, and `:auto` remain excluded.

> **2026-08-09 Plan 21:** free-space RealGrid now supports one scalar Kerr
> plus one flattenable SDO `RamanPolarField`. Each flattened `(y,x)` column
> owns resident intensity/polarization/ADE scratch and, for `thg=false`, its
> own temporal-only c2c Hilbert series; Raman is accumulated before the shared
> time window and joint 3-D transform. Strict hardware verification passed
> 44/44 on a non-square `10×8` grid across N₂ vibration, rotation, and their
> combination with both THG modes. Direct stage errors were `1.28e-15`–
> `1.35e-15`, fixed-solve errors were `2.62e-16`/`2.68e-16`, and the Julia
> Raman-on/off effect was `1.18e-3`. EnvGrid Raman, plasma+Raman, noise,

## 1. Goal

The original objective was to eliminate per-kernel PCIe round-trips by keeping
the simulation state resident on the GPU. The landed `CudaNativeSim` does own
the field, RK stages, error buffers, scratch, cuFFT plans, and the narrow
mode-averaged both-grid Kerr/Raman plus RealGrid PPT/thresholded-ADK state in
VRAM. The current objective is
no longer residency scaffolding; it is maintaining numerical parity with
`CpuNativeSim` while any later scope expansion is separately designed.

`CudaNativeSim` mirrors the CPU `NativeSim`: the **entire state vector and all
RK45 scratch buffers** reside in VRAM for the full duration of a `solve`.

## 2. Traffic Budget (Host ↔ Device)

- **Per RK45 sub-step (6 per step):** ZERO array transfers. Only scalars like `t` or `dt` (and maybe the reduced error scalar) are communicated.
- **Per accepted step:** The `NativeSim::native_resync_field` and `get_field`/`set_field` methods will be the *only* seams that trigger a `cudaMemcpy` from Device to Host. This happens once per accepted step (for dense output/saving to HDF5) and transfers exactly `n_t` elements (the current field). This is highly acceptable.

## 3. Data Residency

The following `NativeSim` fields will be completely migrated to device memory in `CudaNativeSim`:

- `field` (the current spectral field)
- `linop` (the linear operator)
- `ks[7]` (the 7 RK45 stage derivatives)
- `yerr` (the error estimate array)
- `ystage` (the scratch accumulation buffer)
- `eto`, `pto`, `eoo`, `poo` (the time and frequency domain interaction buffers)

## 4. Architectural Implementation (The `NativeBackend` Trait)
The implementation:

1. Renamed the original monolithic simulation to `CpuNativeSim`.
2. Defines a `NativeBackend` trait with the core interface:
   - `fn step(...) -> NativeStepResult`
   - `fn set_field(...)`
   - `fn get_field(...)`
   - `fn set_mode_avg_params(...)`
3. Stores `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` inside the FFI-facing `NativeSim`, rather
   than the originally sketched enum.
4. Delegates `native_step` and every `native_set_*` call through that trait,
   preserving one Julia FFI surface.

The one vtable call per accepted step is immaterial beside CUDA launch/sync
cost and is not a cleanup item.

## 5. cuFFT Lifecycle

- `CudaNativeSim` owns separate D2Z and Z2D `cufftHandle` plans.
- Plans are created during `native_set_mode_avg_params`, because
  `init_native_sim` knows only the spectral length.
- `free_native_sim` drops the backend and destroys the plans.
- Both `cufftPlan1d` return codes and the `cufftExecZ2D`/`D2Z` return codes
  are checked.

## 6. Kernel Requirements (`kernels.cu`)

The landed slice has CUDA kernels for:

1. **RK45 Fusion:** Fusing the stage accumulations (replicating the S1 optimization but in PTX).
2. **Error Estimation:** Computing the embedded error norm against a
   transactional fifth-order trial buffer, using the same global weak norm as
   `CpuNativeSim`.
3. **Exp-Linop:** The `exp(L * dt)` application.
4. **Kerr/Norm Broadcasts:** Applying the windowing and nonlinear scale.
5. **Cumtrapz:** PPT plasma, implemented as deterministic two-level
   256-sample Blelloch prefix scans plus parallel physics finalizers.
6. **ADK rate:** a pointwise `adk_ionization_kernel` for thresholded ADK,
   feeding the same fraction/current/polarization scans as PPT.

The 2026-07-25 correctness repair completed the surrounding pipeline: input
normalization, oversampled FFT sizing/cropping, spectral `pre/β`
normalization, and `ωwin`.

## 7. Scope of V1
The landed scope is **mode-averaged RealGrid or EnvGrid, constant linop, scalar
density, and exactly one plain Kerr response**. Both grids may add at most one
matching SDO Raman response with **1–64 flattened oscillators**; RealGrid alone may add at most one PPT or
thresholded ADK plasma response; mode-averaged EnvGrid may instead add one
intermediate-broadening `:SiO2` Raman response through the resident FFT
convolution path. EnvGrid plasma is explicitly ineligible.
`:auto` selects ADK only from the exact
`_GPU_ADK_N_THRESHOLD = 8193`; `threshold=false`, shot noise, mixtures,
z-dependence, and radial/modal/free-space return or route to ineligibility and
remain on `CpuNativeSim`; `:SiO2` outside mode-averaged EnvGrid remains there.
Plan 05's production-shaped
benchmark stayed below the 1.4x retention bar for every Raman class, so Raman
stays CPU-selected under `:auto`. Eligible GPU configurations are
not automatically rechecked because the project still lacks standing GPU CI.
Within this scope, the backend is numerically hardware-verified.

## 8. Status (updated 2026-08-02 — supersedes the historical reviews below)

The `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` decision in §4 is settled and not a TODO.

**Verified on real CUDA hardware 2026-07-07** (RTX 5060 Ti, CUDA 13.3 —
the same machine, confirmed via `nvidia-smi`) and **wired into `RK45.jl`**,
opt-in via `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` (`RustNativeSimHandle`'s `use_gpu`
kwarg, dispatched from `_gpu_native_eligible`). This first real-hardware run
surfaced and fixed 6 independent bugs invisible to the (self-skipping, no
real GPU) CI-only unit tests — missing `init_gpu_context()`, a
backwards `resync_field` copy direction, temporary-lifetime UB in a kernel
launch that crashed inside `libcuda.so`, a missing `activate_context()`
before launch, a 7-argument kernel called with 6 (wrong argument, out of
order), and a cuFFT plan reused across both transform directions. Full list
with root causes: `BACKLOG.md`'s "GPU-resident stepper" entry under "Done
(recent)". The §5/§6 "Bug found and fixed (2026-07-05)" DP_B5-accumulation
fix below *did* hold up once actually run on hardware — it was correct by
inspection before verification and stayed correct after.

**Actual V1 scope, precisely** (§7's early "mode-averaged RealGrid Kerr
(+plasma)" wording was aspirational until PPT landed 2026-07-11). The current
`CudaNativeSim` `NativeBackend` impl (`cuda_native.rs`) implements
`set_mode_avg_params`, `set_plasma_params` (PPT),
`set_plasma_params_adk` for **thresholded** ADK, and resident SDO Raman via
`set_raman_params`; mode-averaged EnvGrid intermediate-broadening Raman uses
the resident r2c/c2r `set_raman_fft_params` path. Plans 08 and 09 implement
the narrow RealGrid/EnvGrid scalar-Kerr `set_radial_params` paths and the
constant-radius modal RealGrid/EnvGrid scalar-Kerr `set_modal_params` path.
Other `set_*_params` (`set_free_params`, every
`_zdep_*` variant, `set_mode_avg_noise[_cplx]`) still unconditionally return
`-1`; unthresholded ADK deliberately routes to CPU.
`RK45.jl`'s
`_gpu_native_eligible` docstring is the source of truth for exact scope.
Concretely, plasma-eligible configs are: `TransModeAvg`, `RealGrid`, a constant
(non-z-dependent) linop, scalar (non-mixture) density, no shot noise,
exactly one plain Kerr response, and at most one PPT plasma response or
**thresholded** `IonRateADK`, optionally with matching SDO Raman. EnvGrid
supports the same base Kerr and matching `RamanPolarEnv`, but never plasma.
Unthresholded ADK (`threshold=false`) remains unsupported by CUDA and falls
back to CPU. Intermediate-broadening Raman is supported only for
mode-averaged EnvGrid; RealGrid, radial, modal, and free-space variants beyond
Plan 12 fall back to CPU. RealGrid Raman
supports both THG flags; EnvGrid Raman uses envelope intensity.

Plans 08–13 add deliberately narrow radial exceptions: `TransRadial` +
RealGrid or EnvGrid + scalar density + constant linop/norm + exactly one plain
Kerr; RealGrid may additionally carry one PPT or thresholded ADK
`PlasmaCumtrapz`; Plan 12 allows one RealGrid SDO `RamanPolarField`, and Plan
13 allows one EnvGrid SDO `RamanPolarEnv`, each without plasma. There is no
noise, unthresholded ADK, intermediate-broadening radial Raman, mixture, or
z-dependence in this CUDA slice. RealGrid uses resident r2c/c2r state and,
when plasma is present, independent scan segments for each radial column;
Raman uses one contiguous ADE series per radial column (plus the batched
Hilbert series for RealGrid `thg=false`); EnvGrid uses full-spectrum c2c state
and complex QDHT buffers. All are selected only by explicit
`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on`; radial `:auto` remains false until a separate
benchmark establishes a threshold.

**Plasma support added 2026-07-11** (BACKLOG.md S3 item 2; scan implementation
superseded 2026-07-27): PPT ionisation
rate lookup (reuses `ppt_ionization_kernel`, the same kernel and
`SplineSegment` upload format the standalone `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION`
path already uses) → a 3-stage cumtrapz sequence (ionisation fraction,
free-electron current, plasma polarisation — each fused with its adjacent
elementwise transform into one single-thread sequential kernel, since
cumtrapz is an inherently sequential prefix sum and `n_time` is small
enough at mode-averaged scale for one thread to be negligible next to this
step's FFT cost) → accumulated into `pto` before the shared time-window
kernel. Found and fixed a genuine pre-existing bug while wiring this in:
`rhs_mode_avg_real_kernel`'s call site passed its arguments in the wrong
order relative to the kernel's own declaration, so the Kerr kernel had
never actually written its result into the buffer that gets forward-FFT'd
— present since the original 2026-07-05/07 GPU work, never caught because
the existing Kerr-only test's energy was weak enough for the resulting
error to stay under tolerance regardless. See BACKLOG.md's S3 item 2 for
the full writeup, including why the new Kerr+plasma equivalence test uses
a looser (~5e-2) tolerance than the Kerr-only test's ~1e-3 (diagnosed, not
assumed — plasma's Keldysh-exponential field sensitivity amplifies the
existing `n_time`-vs-`n_time_over` gap below, confirmed via an energy sweep
showing linear scaling, and via the CPU-resident native path matching the
Julia oracle to `1.3e-16` on the identical config).

**Historical fidelity gap, fixed 2026-07-25:** the GPU Kerr/plasma FFT buffers/plans
are sized `n_time` (`grid.t`), not `n_time_over` (`grid.to`) — it skips the
oversampling/anti-aliasing padding both `CpuNativeSim` and Julia apply.
Earlier numbers attributed to this approximation are not trustworthy while
the nonlinear RHS is absent. Fix the sizing/crop path as part of S3 item 0,
then remeasure its residual effect; do not preserve it as an intentional
approximation without new evidence.

**Test coverage:** `test/test_native_cuda.jl` has two testitems (Kerr-only,
Kerr+plasma), each constructing a GPU-backed stepper via
`withenv("AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE" => "1")`; both self-skip cleanly on CI
(no GPU/toolkit) but on real hardware assert `_gpu_native_eligible`
actually returned `true` and check full-solve field agreement against
`PreconStepper`. The 2026-07-25 replacement tightens the Kerr/full-solve
tolerances to 1e-12, checks stage scale, and independently measures the
nonlinear control effect so a zero-nonlinearity backend cannot pass. The
2026-07-27 extension deliberately rejects and retries both Kerr and Kerr+PPT,
asserts rejection leaves the field bit-exact, compares `err`/`dtn` against
CPU native, and completes adaptive trajectories at `5.42e-15` / `2.24e-15`
relative agreement. Focused hardware result: 59/59.
`amalthea/src/lib.rs`
and `amalthea/tests/test_gpu_cuda.jl` also self-skip without a GPU —
**still true in CI today**: no CI runner has a GPU, so none of this
executes except when run by hand on hardware like this machine. This is
`BACKLOG.md`'s open "GPU CI coverage" item (Phase G.2) — not resolved by
either the 2026-07-07 or 2026-07-11 verification passes, both one-time
manual runs, not a standing CI job.

**What's still open, in order:**

1. Add scheduled/dedicated GPU CI.
2. The lead has kept standing GPU CI deferred. The local-hardware-gated
   mode-averaged RealGrid ADK and mode-averaged SDO Raman expansions are
   complete and retained; Plan 07's mode-averaged EnvGrid
   intermediate-broadening Raman and Plans 08/09's narrow radial RealGrid and
   EnvGrid scalar-Kerr slices are also complete. Plans 14/15's modal RealGrid
   and EnvGrid scalar-Kerr slices, and Plans 17/18's free-space RealGrid and
   EnvGrid scalar-Kerr slices, are complete. Plan 21's free-space RealGrid SDO
   Raman slice is also complete. Radial physics outside those
   slices remains unimplemented, and `:SiO2` outside the EnvGrid path remains
   CPU-only.
   PPT and ADK share the completed parallel scan pipeline.

The problem-size dispatch policy is:
`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=off/on/auto`, with `auto` selecting Kerr-only problems at
`length(y0) ≥ 16384` on RealGrid and **exactly** `length(y0) ≥ 32768` on
EnvGrid, supported PPT problems at `length(y0) ≥ 8192`, and supported
thresholded ADK problems at **exactly** `length(y0) ≥ 8193`.
The PPT threshold was remeasured after parallelizing the scans: GPU/CPU is
0.82× at n=2049, 1.08× at n=4097, and 2.94× at n=8193, so 8192 deliberately
skips the marginal crossover. Both policies remain behind the explicit
`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` master opt-in. EnvGrid retains its own
threshold because its c2c FFT timing differs from the RealGrid r2c/c2r path;
the RTX 5060 Ti sweep found 16,384 marginal in one batch and 32,768 stable at
3.31–3.98× GPU/CPU. Full evidence is in Luna feature plan 04.

## 9. First expansion completed — mode-averaged RealGrid ADK (2026-07-31)

The strict local hardware baseline completed first on the RTX 5060 Ti (driver
610.43.02): required-CUDA Rust tests, real-PTX release build, focused CUDA/
dense/dispatch tests, and the strict balanced Rust group. This did not register
the machine as a self-hosted runner; standing GPU CI remains deferred.

The landed pointwise CUDA rate kernel matches `AdkIonizationRate::rate`:
absolute field, exact zero for non-finite and below-threshold values, the
transferred power/exponential constants, and the existing optional
cycle-average multiplier. `set_plasma_params_adk` stores those constants and
selects the rate kind; the downstream parallel fraction/current/polarization
scans and finalizers are reused unchanged. The FFI signature does not change.

Eligibility stays narrow: constant linop, scalar density, mode-averaged
RealGrid, exactly one plain Kerr response, at most one **thresholded** ADK
plasma response, and no Raman, shot noise, mixture, z-dependence, or alternate
geometry.
Acceptance requires direct rate-boundary/CPU comparison, nonzero stage-scale
agreement, a Julia ADK control effect at least 100× the comparison tolerance,
fixed-step and adaptive trajectories, and a deliberate rejection whose field
is bit-exact before retry.

Direct strict-CUDA ADK tests and Julia integration (**17/17**) cover rate
boundaries, non-vacuity, stage scale, fixed/adaptive trajectories, and
bit-exact rejected-state retry; the focused CUDA suite passed **101/101**.
At `length(Eω)=8193`, `n_time_over=32768`, warmup plus the minimum of three
five-step batches measured CPU **[3.726, 3.707, 3.683]** ms/step and GPU
**[2.433, 1.965, 1.716]** ms/step: **2.147×**, passing the `>=1.4×` retention
gate. The source and eligibility are retained at the exact threshold **8193**;
do not round it to 8192. `threshold=false` remains CPU fallback. Full evidence
is in `PLANS.md` §11.4 and `PORT_LOG.md`.

## 10. Second expansion — mode-averaged SDO Raman (landed 2026-08-02)

This landed extension adds two ordered SDO subphases to the explicitly opt-in CUDA
backend. The first supports `TransModeAvg` + `RealGrid` +
`RamanPolarField`; the second adds `TransModeAvg` + `EnvGrid` +
`RamanPolarEnv`. Both use the existing SDO/rotational oscillator flattening
and the resident `native_set_raman_params` FFI signature. The
intermediate-broadening `:SiO2` response is documented in §10.4 as a separate
resident FFT-convolution expansion.

### 10.1 RealGrid carrier Raman

`CudaNativeSim` stores the precomputed `PrecomputedStepCoeffs` for each
oscillator and resident real intensity/polarisation buffers. The existing
`raman_ade_kernel` is launched with the mode-averaged oversampled length and a
generated **64-oscillator capacity contract** shared by Rust validation and
the PTX header. N₂ rotation (49) and rotation+vibration (50) therefore run in
CUDA; larger flattened responses remain CPU fallback. The kernel no longer
clamps excess oscillators, and Raman buffer byte counts use checked
multiplication before allocation. The launch has no per-stage allocation or
host copy.
there is no per-stage allocation or host copy. `thg=true` uses `E²` directly.
`thg=false` uses a resident c2c Hilbert plan and the same analytic-signal
convention as `RamanPolarField` before launching the ADE kernel. The result is
accumulated as `pto += ρ·E·P`, before the shared time-window and FFT stages.

### 10.2 EnvGrid envelope Raman

The CUDA setup gains a c2c mode-averaged plan and complex time/frequency
buffers. The time-domain intensity is `0.5·|E|²`; the ADE output remains real;
the contribution is accumulated as `pto += E·(ρ·P)`. The existing field/RK
buffers and EnvGrid Kerr path are reused. No `thg` branch exists for
`RamanPolarEnv`.

### 10.3 Eligibility, fallback, and verification

Eligibility remains constant-linop, scalar-density, mode-averaged, one plain
Kerr plus at most one `CombinedRamanResponse` made from 1–64 SDO or flattened
rotational oscillators, or one matching EnvGrid intermediate-broadening
response. Mixtures, shot noise, z-dependent Raman, and radial/modal/free-space
Raman combinations beyond Plans 12–13 and Plan 21 remain `NativeIneligible` and use the CPU
resident/Julia fallback; `:SiO2` is also fallback outside mode-averaged EnvGrid. The
master CUDA opt-in and explicit
`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` correctness route do not change.

Verification passed with a direct CUDA-vs-CPU-ADE stage check, a non-vacuous
Raman-on/off oracle effect, fixed-step and adaptive reject/retry trajectories,
and explicit `:SiO2` CPU fallback coverage. The strict CUDA item passed 53/53;
RealGrid and EnvGrid GPU-vs-CPU fixed trajectories were at approximately
`5e-16` and `2e-16`, respectively. Plan 05 then measured the production-shaped
Raman classes with two warm-up steps and three five-step batches. The largest
speedup was only `1.141x` (EnvGrid, one vibrational oscillator, `Nω=32768`),
below the established `1.4x` retention bar; the rotational classes stayed at
parity. Therefore every Raman `:auto` policy threshold is deliberately unset:
supported Raman remains CPU-selected under `:auto`, while `:on` remains the
explicit CUDA correctness/experiment route. The complete table and the bounded
large-rotational benchmark gotcha are recorded in
`luna-feature-plans/LUNA_FEATURE_PLAN_05_GPU_RAMAN_AUTO_POLICY.md`.

### 10.4 EnvGrid intermediate-broadening Raman (`:SiO2`, Plan 07)

`RamanRespIntermediateBroadening` has no finite SDO decomposition, so the
mode-averaged EnvGrid path prepares its fixed response spectrum once through
`native_set_raman_fft_params`. `CudaNativeSim` then packs `0.5|E|²`, performs
r2c → resident spectrum multiply → c2r, and accumulates `E·(ρP)` entirely on
the device. Setup is staged behind RAII ownership and committed only after
allocation, plan creation, and response upload succeed; failed replacement
setups therefore preserve the active configuration.

Plan 07's focused strict-CUDA bucket passed **157/157**. The direct stage
relative error was `5.74e-16`, the six-step fixed trajectory was `1.46e-16`,
and the test covered adaptive rejection/rollback plus CPU fallback and
non-vacuity. The `:auto` threshold remains unset deliberately: explicit
`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` is required for this correctness path.

### 10.5 Radial RealGrid scalar Kerr (Plan 08)

The radial setter reuses `native_set_radial_params`. Setup copies Julia's
column-major QDHT matrix into the row-major device convention once, uploads
the normalization/window arrays, and stages separate D2Z/Z2D cuFFT plans.
The RHS is resident for `expand → inverse FFT columns → QDHT ldiv → Kerr →
window → QDHT mul → forward FFT columns → crop/normalization`; the only host
work in the hot path is scalar setup and launch submission. Shape, finiteness,
integer-range, allocation, and cuFFT errors are rejected before commit, so a
failed replacement leaves the active setup usable.

The test `test/test_native_cuda_radial.jl` passed **25/25** on the RTX 5060 Ti.
It covers a nonsymmetric QDHT primitive, a non-vacuous Kerr-on/off control,
direct stage and fixed-solve agreement (`4.772174254620178e-16`), invalid/null
setup rollback, and adaptive rejection/retry. CPU radial coverage remains
3/3, with single-step `1.142189692971526e-17` and full-solve
`1.2869428033620095e-16`. The temporal pad scale is intentionally distinct
from QDHT `scaleRK`; the nonsymmetric probe caught the otherwise silent
convention mix-up. No automatic radial threshold is claimed.

### 10.6 Radial EnvGrid scalar Kerr (Plan 09)

Plan 09 extends the same transactional `native_set_radial_params` contract to
`TransRadial` + EnvGrid. The staged state uses complex time/QDHT scratch,
full-spectrum c2c column transforms, the transferred real QDHT matrix, and
complex normalization. Its device RHS mirrors `CpuNativeSim::rhs_radial_env`:
low/high spectrum placement and `n_time_over/n_time` scaling, inverse c2c and
`1/n_time_over`, complex QDHT ldiv, `3/4` envelope Kerr, time window, complex
QDHT mul, forward c2c, `n_time/n_time_over` crop scale, and final M
normalization. The complex QDHT kernel handles real and imaginary parts
explicitly, preserving asymmetric reference matrices and fields.

`test/test_native_cuda_radial_env.jl` is the focused verification item. It
requires the real CUDA path in strict mode and covers an asymmetric complex
stage, a nonsymmetric QDHT/c2c replacement, invalid transactional rollback,
non-vacuity, fixed solve, and adaptive rejection/retry. EnvGrid radial CUDA
is explicit-on only; radial `:auto`, unsupported plasma/Raman combinations,
noise, mixtures, and
z-dependent configurations remain CPU-selected. On the RTX 5060 Ti it passed
24/24 with asymmetric direct-stage error `4.262893614543232e-16` and fixed
full-solve error `2.871085295458848e-15`.

### 10.7 Radial RealGrid PPT plasma (Plan 10)

Plan 10 extends the RealGrid radial state with one resident PPT plasma
response. The flattened layout is column-major in the radial columns:
`i = column*n_time_over + t`. Each column owns its rate, fraction, current,
polarization, and scan scratch. A 256-thread Blelloch block scan writes one
block total per `(column, block)`; each finalizer sums only preceding blocks in
that same column, so a partial last block and multiple blocks per column do
not leak prefix state across radii. The scan recurrence is the CPU
`cumtrapz`: `q[0]=0`, `q[t]=q[t-1] + 0.5*(x[t-1]+x[t])*dt`. The fraction,
current, and polarization finalizers preserve the CPU PPT formulas and add
`density*P` to `pto` before the existing radial time window.

The field sampled by the PPT kernels is the post-QDHT radial time field
(`radial_qdht_d`), not the pre-transform scratch (`radial_eto_d`). This is an
important resident-state invariant because the RealGrid QDHT is out-of-place.
Setup is transactional: radial state is established first, then plasma
buffers and the PPT spline are staged; invalid or null plasma replacement
leaves the live radial Kerr configuration usable.

`test/test_native_cuda_radial_plasma.jl` passed **27/27** on the RTX 5060 Ti.
Direct CPU-vs-CUDA stage error was `1.5647312256418479e-15`, fixed-solve error
was `4.756600300395168e-16`, and the strong-field plasma-on/off effect was
`1.7924786820029344e-5` on CUDA (the Julia control was
`1.7924786820007026e-5`). Native-vs-Julia strong-field error was
`5.848007396073851e-16`. The test also covers multi-block/partial-column
isolation, failed setup rollback, and adaptive rejection/retry. Radial
EnvGrid plasma, ADK, Raman, noise, mixtures, z-dependent physics, and
automatic dispatch remain outside this plan.

### 10.8 Radial RealGrid thresholded ADK (Plan 11)

Plan 11 adds one thresholded `IonRateADK` response to the same radial
RealGrid pipeline.  The CUDA pointwise launch reuses Julia's seven
precomputed ADK constants and the existing exact contract: `abs(E) >= thr`
is active, while non-finite fields and fields below `thr` produce zero.  The
rate is evaluated from the post-QDHT field in the flat layout
`column*n_time_over + t`; the Plan 10 segmented fraction, phase/current, and
polarization scans are unchanged.  This keeps each radial column independent,
including multi-block columns, and preserves the CPU cumtrapz normalization.

Radial ADK setup now stages its rate/fraction/current/polarization scratch and
per-column scan totals transactionally.  Invalid constants, null handles, and
allocation failures return without replacing the active radial configuration.
The capability gate admits only `IonRateADK(threshold=true)` alongside one
plain Kerr response; `threshold=false`, EnvGrid plasma, and radial `:auto`
remain CPU-selected.  The focused test also retains the exact-threshold and
non-finite pointwise CUDA boundary coverage, and checks rejected-step state
preservation.

`test/test_native_cuda_radial_adk.jl` passed **43/43** on the RTX 5060 Ti.
Direct CPU-vs-CUDA stage error was `1.4991322388752626e-15`, fixed-solve error
was `1.712696193041123e-16`, the Julia strong-field ADK-on/off effect was
`2.786765208889846e-8`, and native-vs-Julia strong-field error was
`3.253050910467547e-16`.  Below/above-threshold column isolation, invalid
setup rollback, adaptive rejection, and retry all passed.

### 10.9 Radial RealGrid SDO Raman (Plan 12)

Plan 12 extends the same RealGrid radial pipeline with one scalar-density SDO
`RamanPolarField` and no plasma. Intensity, polarization, and Hilbert scratch
are contiguous `(n_time_over, n_r)` buffers. The ADE kernel receives one series
per radial column and initializes oscillator state inside that series thread;
`thg=false` uses a batched c2c Hilbert plan plus a column-local parity mask.
Raman is accumulated before the radial time window and QDHT multiplication,
with no host transfer during an RHS evaluation. The gate accepts 1–64 flattened
SDO oscillators (N₂ vibration, rotation=49, and rotation+vibration=50), keeps
radial `:auto` false, and rejects plasma+Raman, EnvGrid Raman in this
RealGrid path, mixtures, and noise.

`test/test_native_cuda_radial_raman.jl` covers eligibility, both THG modes,
vibration-only and N₂ rotational responses, direct stages, fixed solves,
column isolation, non-vacuity, and rejected adaptive steps. Its CPU controls
and `test/test_native_radial_raman.jl` passed; strict CUDA execution is still
pending a matching driver because this host reports `cuInit failed: 100`
(no CUDA device in the current sandbox; prior elevated runs reported the
userspace/kernel mismatch `803`).

### 10.10 Radial EnvGrid SDO Raman (Plan 13)

Plan 13 extends the Plan 09 full-spectrum radial EnvGrid pipeline with one
scalar-density SDO `RamanPolarEnv`. The existing complex radial time buffer is
used directly: `raman_intensity_env_kernel` computes `0.5*|E|²` for every
`(time, radial-column)` cell, one `raman_ade_kernel` thread integrates each
column's oscillator series, and `raman_accumulate_env_kernel` adds
`density*E*P` to the complex `pto`. There is no Hilbert transform or carrier
`thg` branch. The Raman stage is resident between envelope Kerr and the shared
time-window/QDHT/forward-c2c tail.

The gate admits one EnvGrid `RamanPolarEnv` with a non-empty combined SDO
response of 1–64 flattened oscillators, paired with one plain Kerr response.
EnvGrid plasma, intermediate-broadening (`:SiO2`) Raman, mixtures, noise, and
radial `:auto` remain CPU-selected. The focused test is
`test/test_native_cuda_radial_env_raman.jl`; it covers vibration/rotation
capacity and dispatch, complex two-column isolation, direct stages, fixed
solve/non-vacuity, and rejected adaptive steps. CPU radial EnvGrid Raman
coverage remains in `test/test_native_radial_env_raman.jl`.

Strict CUDA construction is still pending on this host: the focused strict
run reaches all 10 eligibility checks, then fails at `cuInit failed: 100`.
No hardware tolerance is claimed until the test is rerun on a matching CUDA
device/driver host.

## Historical: Status (2026-07-05 review, pre-hardware — superseded above)
Implemented as `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` rather than the `enum` described in §4 (functionally
equivalent, just not what was planned). **Not wired to Julia** — no `src/*.jl` file calls
`init_cuda_native_sim`; this is inert scaffolding with zero effect on the shipped CPU native
path. **Untested on real hardware**: this dev machine has an NVIDIA driver but no `nvcc`
toolkit, so `kernels.cu` never compiles to real PTX and `CudaNativeSim::new` fails to load
(the `lib.rs` unit test self-skips).

**Bug found and fixed (2026-07-05):** `CudaNativeSim::step` was never applying the final
5th-order solution weights (`DP_B5` in `native.rs`'s `CpuNativeSim::step`) before accepting a
step — it only ran the internal-stage accumulation (`DP_B`) and then re-propagated the
*unmodified* old field, silently dropping the entire nonlinear contribution. Fixed by adding
an extra `rk45_accumulate_stage_fn` launch (in-place on `field_d`, using `DP_B5` weights,
gated on `locextrap != 0` exactly like the CPU reference) right before the final
`apply_prop` call. Compiles and passes the existing (self-skipping) unit tests, but **has
still never been run on real CUDA hardware** — the fix is only checked for logical parity
against `CpuNativeSim::step`, not numerically verified.

**Opt-in gate added:** `init_cuda_native_sim` now refuses to initialize (returns null +
prints a warning to stderr) unless `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` is set in the environment,
and prints a second warning on successful opt-in reminding the caller this path is
unverified. This is deliberately stricter than a normal `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_*` feature toggle —
those default-enable once verified; this one requires explicit, repeated opt-in until it has
been checked against the Julia oracle on real GPU hardware. See
`test_cuda_native_sim_ffi_gated_by_env_var` in `lib.rs`.

Still not wired to Julia/`RK45.jl`'s dispatch — do that only after real-hardware
verification. See `BACKLOG.md`'s "GPU-resident stepper" entry for the full status.
