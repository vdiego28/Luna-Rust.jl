## 1. Why this document exists

The port's goal was to make the per-step propagation hot loop run entirely in
Rust, with Julia retaining setup, orchestration, output, and a correctness
fallback. That goal is implemented for every native-eligible CPU
configuration. This document now records the legacy callback architecture,
the resident architecture that replaced it, and the decisions future work
must preserve.

## 2. Legacy architecture still retained (per-kernel offload + callback stepper)

The compatibility path offloads five kernels to Rust, each behind an opt-in env toggle that
defaults **off** (`get(ENV, "AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_*", "0") == "1"`):

| Kernel | Toggle | Julia site | Rust handle |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| PPT ionization LUT | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION` | `src/Ionisation.jl:516` | `RustIonizationHandle` |
| Raman SDO ADE | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN` | `src/Nonlinear.jl:379` | `RustRamanHandle` |
| Zeisberger neff/β | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION` | `src/Antiresonant.jl:251` | `RustZeisbergerHandle` |
| Marcatili neff/β | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION` | `src/Capillary.jl:445` | `RustMarcatiliHandle` |
| QDHT k↔r transform | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT` | `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:665,675` | `RustQdhtHandle` |
| RK45 tableau/PI control | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_STEPPER` | `src/RK45.jl:24` | `RustPreconStepHandle` |

Each follows the same lifecycle pattern: a `mutable struct *Handle` wrapping a
`Ptr{Cvoid}` with a GC finalizer that calls `free_*`; an env toggle gating
construction; an `@testitem tags=[:rust]` equivalence test guarding the boundary.

### 2.1 Why this path could not meet the resident-loop goal

The RK45 stepper is **interaction-picture Dormand-Prince**: each accepted step
performs ~7 nonlinear-RHS evaluations and ~13 linear-propagator applications
(`src/RK45.jl:173-229`). When `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_STEPPER=1`, the Rust side
(`amalthea/src/ffi.rs:1002` `precon_step_inner`) owns only the Butcher tableau,
FSAL bookkeeping, error norm, and the Lund PI controller. For the actual math it
calls **back into Julia** through two C function pointers on every stage:

```
ffi.rs: prop_fn(t1, t2, y, …)   →  RK45.jl:_prop_cfun  →  Julia prop!  (exp-linop)
ffi.rs: fbar_fn(t1, t2, y, k, …) →  RK45.jl:_fbar_cfun  →  Julia fbar!  (full RHS)
```

So with **all per-kernel toggles on**, one propagation step still executes in Julia
6–7×: every FFT (there is no Rust FFT at all), Kerr, the plasma `cumtrapz`
integrals and current assembly, all `norm!`/window broadcasts, the
`exp(linop·dt)` application, and — for modal — the cubature-wrapped overlap
integrals. The toggles offload only the leaf kernels listed above; the
*structure* of the loop, and most of its cost, is Julia.

**Conclusion reached by the phased port:** flipping leaf-kernel defaults could
never remove the callback boundary. This is why the default CPU path now uses
the resident backend below instead.

## 3. Implemented architecture (resident field + native RHS)

### 3.1 `NativeSim` — a Rust-resident simulation state

One opaque Rust handle owns, for the lifetime of a single
`solve`, everything the loop touches:

- the spectral field `Eω` and all scratch buffers (`Et`, `Pt`, `Pω`, the 7 `ks`,
  `yerr`, interpolation buffer);
- the FFTW plans (forward/inverse, normal and oversampled grids);
- the static arrays copied once at setup: ω grid, time/frequency windows
  (`towin`, `ωwin`), the linear-operator array (or its z-dependent builder), the
  response coefficients, and the QDHT T-matrix where applicable.

Julia constructs it with `init_native_sim(...)`, configures the geometry and
responses through `native_set_*` calls, hands over the initial field with
`set_field`, and drives repeated `native_step` calls. Julia intentionally
retains the outer solve/output loop because `stepfun`, dense-output sampling,
and output callbacks live there; the nonlinear stages and propagator do not
return to Julia. The resident field is pushed back only at explicit seams such
as `native_resync_field`.

### 3.2 FFI surface

```
init_native_sim(linop, n) -> *mut NativeSim
free_native_sim(*mut NativeSim)
native_set_fftw_plans(...)
native_set_<geometry/response>_params(...)
set_field(*mut NativeSim, *const Complex<f64>, n)
get_field(*const NativeSim, *mut Complex<f64>, n)
native_resync_field(*mut NativeSim, ...)
native_step(*mut NativeSim, …) -> NativeStepResult
get_ks_stage(...) / native_compute_extra_stages(...)   # order-5 dense output
native_apply_prop(...)                                 # interpolation frame
```

There is deliberately no `native_solve` entry point in the implemented API.
The existing `precon_step_ffi` and pure Julia `PreconStepper` remain as
compatibility paths and equivalence oracles.

### 3.3 Julia integration point

`RK45.solve_precon` has a top-level branch: native path vs.
the existing `PreconStepper`/`RustPreconStepper`. Selection is once per `solve`,
not per op. The high-level `prop_capillary` / `prop_gnlse` interface is unchanged.

## 4. Key decisions and rationale

### 4.1 FFT: bind FFTW, not `rustfft`
Julia uses FFTW via `FFTW.jl`. Binding the **same FFTW C library** from Rust
makes the transforms bit-identical, so every ported phase can be validated to
~1e-13 against the Julia oracle instead of needing a method-difference tolerance.
This collapses the hardest validation risk in the whole port.

- *Trade-off:* a C link-time/runtime dependency on FFTW. Mitigated — FFTW is
  already a Julia dependency present on every Luna install.
- *Recorded alternative:* `rustfft` (pure Rust, no C dep) remains a future
  option; it would move FFT equivalence into the ~1e-13 (summation-order) tier
  and is acceptable if the FFTW dependency ever becomes a portability problem.

### 4.2 Resident field, not per-op FFI
The per-stage Julia round-trip was *the* reason the legacy loop was Julia-bound.
The resident `NativeSim` removes it. Per-op FFI (e.g.
"call Rust for just the FFT") would add FFI overhead without removing the
round-trip, and is explicitly rejected.

### 4.3 Keep the Julia pipeline as a reachable whole-pipeline fallback
Once the field is resident, there is no natural per-op fallback — it is
native-loop vs. the old Julia loop, chosen once at `solve` time. We keep the
entire Julia pipeline reachable and emit a **one-time `@warn`** on fallback;
the eligible resident CPU-native path defaults on.
Three reasons:

1. Portability — CPU-only / unbuilt-lib installs keep working (`.so` missing).
2. **The Julia path is the equivalence oracle.** Every test compares native
   output against it; deleting it would delete the test baseline.
3. **Scope restrictions.** Phases 1-7 each cover a narrow slice of Luna's
   configuration space (specific grid types, response combinations, mode
   kinds, ...). As implemented (Phase 8), `RustNativeStepper`'s constructor
   throws a `NativeIneligible` exception for anything outside that slice;
   `solve_precon` catches *only* that type and falls back to `PreconStepper`
   — any other exception (a genuine FFI error, an invariant violation) still
   propagates and crashes, unchanged. This is why native-eligibility is a
   runtime, per-`solve` decision (`RK45.jl`'s `native_ok`/`NativeIneligible`
   catch), not a static, config-time one: the same call site must route
   both the common case (fast, native) and the long tail of narrow-scope
   configs (correct, Julia) through one function.

### 4.4 Phase ordering by `Trans*` complexity
Mode-averaged is the simplest geometry (1 inverse + 1 forward FFT, no spatial
transform). It proves the resident-field architecture end-to-end before the hard
geometries (modal cubature, free-space 3D FFT) are attempted. Each phase is
independently shippable and independently testable.

### 4.5 GPU is a backend implementation, not a separate physics model

`NativeSim` is a `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` dispatching to `CpuNativeSim` or the
explicitly opt-in `CudaNativeSim`. Both must implement the same transferred
physics, not merely the same RK tableau. In particular, GPU mode-averaged
setup must retain and use `ωwin`, `sidx`, `pre`, `β`, `nlscale`, and
`sqrt_aeff`, and must reproduce every numbered step in
`CpuNativeSim::rhs_mode_avg_real`.

That invariant is now enforced. The 2026-07-25 repair made the CUDA setter
retain those values, ported the CPU path's input scaling, oversampled
crop/rescale, spectral normalization, and frequency windowing, and fixed the
uninitialized first RK stage. Non-vacuous hardware tests measure the nonlinear
share before asserting CPU/Julia equivalence. `CudaNativeSim` remains
explicitly opt-in because its scope is narrow and there is no standing GPU CI;
the default `CpuNativeSim` is unaffected.

## 5. Geometry → phase map

| RHS path | Julia source | Phase | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------|-------|
| `TransModeAvg` + Kerr | `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:531` | 1 | ✅ done | RealGrid first |
| Plasma (`PlasmaCumtrapz`) + EnvGrid Kerr | `src/Nonlinear.jl:161`, `:81` | 2 | ✅ done | rate LUT already Rust |
| `TransRadial` + QDHT | `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:663` | 3 | ✅ done | QDHT already Rust, made resident |
| Raman (`RamanPolar`) | `src/Nonlinear.jl:357` | 4 | ✅ done | ADE already Rust, made resident |
| `TransModal` + overlap cubature | `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:421` | 5 | ✅ done | narrow scope: `libcubature` reused (dlopen, not reimplemented), `HE,n=1`/`full=false`/Kerr-only |
| `TransFree` (3D FFT) | `src/NonlinearRHS.jl:826` | 6 | ✅ done | joint 3-D FFTW plan (same libfftw3, new plan rank); RealGrid + const_norm_free + Kerr-only |
| z-dependent linop assembly | `src/LinearOps.jl:77,185,337` | 7 | ✅ done | narrow scope: mode-averaged, graded-core constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` (`Capillary.gradient`, two-point pressure gradient) only; radial/modal/free-space z-dependent `nfun` deferred — see MATH.md §3.5 |
| Default-flip + cleanup | — | 8 | ✅ done | `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` defaults to `"1"`; every scope restriction now a catchable `NativeIneligible` → Julia fallback instead of a crash |

## 6. Out of scope (stays Julia) — the three categories, and which is a real barrier

With the port complete (Phases 0-8 + D-I), the Julia code that remains
un-ported falls into exactly three categories. Only the third is a
genuine technical barrier; the first two are choices.

**(a) One-time setup and orchestration — stays Julia by design.**
The high-level `Interface.jl` / `Output.jl` / `Grid.jl` / `Fields.jl`
setup code (grid construction, mode solvers, Sellmeier/gas data, pulse
synthesis), HDF5 output (`Output.jl`), parameter scans (`Scans.jl`),
plotting/processing/stats. This runs once per simulation, costs
milliseconds, and porting it buys nothing. The port's goal was "the
*per-step hot loop* is 100% Rust", and that is achieved for every
native-eligible configuration; ineligible configurations intentionally use
the whole-pipeline Julia fallback listed in the support matrix.

**(b) Ineligible-but-portable configs — "won't", not "can't".**
BACKLOG.md Phase I items 5-6: `StepIndexMode`/`ZeisbergerMode`/
`VincettiMode` in modal, plasma/Raman in free-space, mixtures in
modal/free-space, and similar low-level-API-only combinations. These
are ordinary numerics that *could* be ported exactly like everything
else was — they fall back via `NativeIneligible` because they are only
reachable through the low-level API in combinations almost nobody
uses, so effort/value rules them out, not feasibility.

**(c) Arbitrary user closures — the one genuine barrier.**
The low-level API accepts any Julia function as a nonlinear response,
density profile, or mode field. Rust cannot execute arbitrary Julia
code without a per-sample FFI callback — which is exactly the
round-trip this port exists to eliminate. This is why the guards for
"unrecognized bare `f!` closures" exist: *recognizable* structures
(splines, two/multi-point gradients, the standard response types) are
transferred as **data** and evaluated natively; anything else falls
back to the Julia stepper. Closing this category fully would mean a
declarative config format instead of Julia closures — that is
SUGGESTIONS.md item 14's CLI, which sidesteps Julia entirely rather
than porting it.

**Native-path FFTW planner wisdom (opt-in, default off).** Unlike the
per-kernel toggles in §2 (default off because the *feature* is optional),
`RustNativeStepper`'s own FFTW wisdom cache is default off for a
determinism reason: importing wisdom before planning lets accumulated
on-disk/in-process wisdom perturb plan selection, which — via the RK45
controller's near-cancellation sensitivity (CLAUDE.md's Phase 2 gotcha) —
can shift the adaptive step-size path run to run. Set
`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_FFTW_WISDOM=1` to opt back in. See
`docs/dev/native-port/PLANS.md §1` for the full analysis and
`BACKLOG.md` S1 item 1 for the resolution. The determinism boundary this
leaves in place: exact bit-level step-path reproducibility across runs is
only guaranteed with one fresh process per simulation (native shares
FFTW's single process-global wisdom pool with Julia's own `FFTW.jl`,
regardless of the on-disk cache toggle).

## 7. Post-port CPU ownership and concurrency (2026-08-24)

The resident stepper now has one allocation-free attempt boundary:
`RustNativeStepper.step!` copies the left endpoint into its existing `y`
buffer, and Rust temporarily transfers ownership of `field`/`ystage` while an
RHS is evaluated. The vectors are restored before return or panic propagation;
the FFI panic boundary therefore remains usable. `locextrap=false` copies the
unpropagated final stage into `yn` before the last RHS, while the normal
local-extrapolation path stays copy-free. The solve loop skips field resync only
for the exact built-in `donothing!`; all user callbacks remain conservative.

Resident radial construction initializes Julia's configured
`libblastrampoline` directly and stores a handle-local QDHT policy:
Rayon (`off`), thresholded configured BLAS (`auto`, default), or forced BLAS
(`on`). Deterministic mode overrides all three with Rayon. The process-global
symbol table is shared safely with legacy QDHT handles, but construction order
no longer changes resident eligibility.

The CPU Raman solver stores oscillator state and eight recurrence coefficients
as structure-of-arrays, dispatching to AVX2 on supported x86_64 and NEON on
AArch64, with a scalar tail and portable scalar fallback. CUDA retains the
packed coefficient ABI. SIMD lanes update state together, then polarization is
accumulated lane-by-lane in oscillator order.

The retained Julia modal fallback now mirrors Rust's ownership rule for
recognized standard responses: each spawned callback task owns a
`ModalScratch` containing `ToSpace` state, transform arrays, response scratch,
and optional noise buffers; tasks write disjoint output columns while
Cubature's adaptive subdivision remains serial. Unknown/stateful closures and
legacy Rust handles remain sequential. Independent simulation concurrency
continues to use processes: `QueueExec(threads_per_worker=1)` bounds Julia,
FFTW, and resident Rayon in every spawned worker and always tears workers down
in `finally`.
