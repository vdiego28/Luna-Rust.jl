# Backlog

Deferred work and known issues for Amalthea.jl. Severity: 🔴 correctness · 🟡 robustness/CI · ⚪ informational.

> **Where things live.** This file is the *live* backlog. Completed work —
> Phases A-J, tracks S1 and S4, and the rolling "Done (recent)" log — moved to
> [`ARCHIVE.md`](ARCHIVE.md) with its section names unchanged. Cross-references
> below to a phase, to S1/S4, or to "Done (recent)" resolve there.

## Start here — current resume queue (2026-08-08)

This is the authoritative short queue. The long sections below retain design
history and measured evidence, but older words such as "next", "not started",
or "verified" inside a superseded narrative do not outrank this list.

> **Current handoff:** `main` is `4925c67` (`1.0.3-DEV`), which merges the
> published `v1.0.2` release branch after its development-metadata bump. The
> GPU adaptive
> repair/parallel PPT scan branch and the Windows scheduler portability/
> visibility hotfix are merged, and their remote branches were deleted after
> ancestry checks. Main test run `30642534593` passed all **16/16** jobs and
> documentation run `30642537095` passed. `origin` now has only `main` and the
> required `gh-pages` deployment branch. The live queue is deliberately short:
> standing required-CUDA CI remains deferred by the lead (item 2 below).
> Broader mode-averaged SDO Raman was completed and hardware-verified on
> 2026-08-02; radial RealGrid and EnvGrid scalar-Kerr GPU slices and radial
> RealGrid/EnvGrid SDO Raman Plans 12–13 are complete. Plan 14's modal
> RealGrid scalar-Kerr surface was hardware-verified on 2026-08-04, and Plan
> 15's modal EnvGrid scalar-Kerr c2c extension was hardware-verified on
> 2026-08-08. Plan 21's free-space RealGrid SDO Raman extension was
> hardware-verified on 2026-08-09. The only live queue item is standing required CUDA CI, which
> remains deferred by the lead. Do not recreate a
> completed integration branch as a resume step.

> The upstream Luna.jl review is recorded in
> [`native-port/UPSTREAM_TRIAGE.md`](native-port/UPSTREAM_TRIAGE.md). Its
> candidates are not live implementation commitments until they are designed
> in `PLANS.md` and promoted into this backlog.

> **Completed 2026-07-31 campaign — four bounded work units closed.** The lead
> selected and completed:
> (a) make `norm=` fallback and `locextrap=false` correct across Julia/legacy/
> resident/CUDA steppers; (b) harden `native_step`, the mode-averaged length
> contract, and transactional CUDA setup; (c) remove project-owned CI warnings,
> require real PTX in strict-CUDA mode, apply least-privilege workflow
> permissions, and restore this machine's local CUDA baseline without making it
> a runner; (d) after that green baseline, implement mode-averaged RealGrid
> thresholded ADK. The retained benchmark is **2.147×** at `n=8193`, so
> `:auto` selects it at the exact `_GPU_ADK_N_THRESHOLD = 8193`.
> `threshold=false` remains an explicit CPU fallback. `PLANS.md` §11 and the
> appended `PORT_LOG.md` entries carry the full evidence. Standing GPU CI is
> the remaining live queue item from this campaign; the Raman expansion is
> recorded in `PLANS.md` §12 and the appended `PORT_LOG.md` entry.

> **Release `v1.0.2` — PUBLISHED 2026-07-31:** the reviewed Campaign 11
> changes passed the prepared branch's 16-job hosted matrix, then tag-driven
> release workflow `30658681539` built the canonical Linux/macOS/Windows
> binaries. GitHub Release `v1.0.2` is public and its downloaded assets all
> pass `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt`. Development metadata is now advancing to
> `1.0.3-DEV` / `1.0.3.dev0`, and the release branch is now merged into `main`
> at `4925c67`.

> **2026-07-25 agent wave — four of the five queue items below were worked
> and are resolved or closed.** Four agent branches merged with no conflicts.
> Per-item records: `native-port/portlog-inbox/{gpu-nonlinearity,
> examples-repair,prebuilt-asset-compat,raman-short-kernel}.md`, each also
> summarized in `PORT_LOG.md`.
>
> **Gate, re-run by the lead on the integrated tree (not agent-reported):**
> full 7-group `run_full_gate.py` **exit 0, 774.3s** — physics 1657/1657,
> rust 42247/42248, sim_multimode 33/33, sim_interface 314/314,
> sim_propagation 18/18, io 2302/2302, fields 334/334. Supplemental
> `examples` group **20/20**. GPU verified separately by running the `rust`
> group under `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1 AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on`:
> `test_native_cuda.jl` **31/31** — see item 9 for why that same env makes
> 18 *unrelated* CPU-native tests fail.

1. 🟢 **Restore nonlinear physics on `CudaNativeSim` (S3 item 0) — DONE
   2026-07-25, verified on real hardware.** `set_mode_avg_params` now uploads
   `pre`/`β`/`sidx`/`ωwin`/`nlscale`/`sqrt_aeff`, and a new
   `compute_rhs_mode_avg` helper ports CPU Steps 1/2/5/6/7 alongside the
   existing Kerr cubic; all Kerr/plasma buffers and cuFFT plans resized to
   `n_time_over` (**this also closes S3 item 6**, which is not separable —
   Steps 1 and 5 are crop/pad operations); both `cufftPlan1d` return codes
   checked. A **second, undiagnosed bug** was found in review:
   `CudaNativeSim::set_field` never seeded `ks_d[0]` (CPU's does), so the
   first `step()` read uninitialized `cuMemAlloc` memory — latent, and the
   Kerr fix would have activated it. Measured on the RTX 5060 Ti: stage
   derivatives `3.5e-13` → `~1230` (CPU-native agreement ~1e-15), fixed-step
   full-solve vs the Julia oracle **3.5e-16**, `Luna.run` dense output
   **1.25e-7**. Test tolerances tightened `1e-3`/`5e-2` → `1e-12`, with the
   config's nonlinear share (`rel_nl` ≈ 4.5e-4) now *measured in-test* and
   asserted to exceed the tolerance by >100× — the AGENTS.md §3 step 4 rule
   whose absence let this ship. The `err` weak-norm placeholder and serial
   PPT scans are now fixed too (items 8 and 12 below); GPU scope beyond
   mode-averaged RealGrid Kerr(+PPT) is still untouched.
2. 🟡 **Add standing GPU CI — deliberately deferred 2026-07-25 (lead's
   call).** A CUDA-equipped scheduled/dedicated runner must run the CUDA Rust
   tests and `test/test_native_cuda.jl`; until then every GPU change also
   requires a recorded manual hardware run. **Item 1 is the argument for
   this:** a zero-nonlinearity GPU backend survived over two weeks because
   nothing re-measured it automatically.
   **2026-07-28 review addition:** a runner alone is insufficient. The Julia
   CUDA tests catch any `RustNativeStepper` construction error and convert it
   to `@test_skip`; the Rust GPU tests likewise return successfully on any
   CUDA initialization error. On a machine that is expected to have CUDA, a
   broken kernel load or backend regression can therefore produce a green
   "skipped" job. **Required-hardware mode is implemented 2026-07-28:**
   `AMALTHEA_REQUIRE_CUDA_TESTS=1` turns CUDA initialization, missing-library,
   and GPU-dispatch fallback paths into failures in both Rust and Julia.
   Strict real-hardware runs passed (`cargo test` 73/73; focused resident
   CUDA+dense/dispatch Julia suite 104/104). The remaining work is the
   lead-deferred runner itself: set this variable in that job and keep the
   resident CUDA testitems in its required manifest.
3. 🟢 **Repair the known-broken low-level examples — 7 of 7 DONE
   2026-07-27.** Both documented classes fixed (`linop` before assignment ×6;
   `norm_modal(grid.ω)` ×3) and re-audited across all 44 example files — the
   file list was exactly right. Four *further* bugs surfaced that the
   original audit missed because its harness stopped at the first error per
   file (a scalar `ϕ` where `Fields.PulseField.ϕ::Vector{Float64}` is
   required; and in `elliptical_env.jl` an undefined `τ`, a missing broadcast
   dot, a missing `import FFTW`, and a positional `normfun` where `setup`
   takes `norm!` as a keyword). Regression cases for both classes added to
   `test/test_examples_smoke.jl` and verified to fail against the unfixed
   originals. The seventh file's apparent library defect was corrected
   2026-07-27 after tracing the Cubature callback: its
   `PlasmaCumtrapz` was constructed with a vector example field even though
   `components=:xy` supplies an N×2 field. The example now allocates N×2
   plasma buffers, `PlasmaCumtrapz` reports a focused shape error for this
   misuse, and `test/test_transmodal_vector_plasma.jl` covers the actual
   `full=true` + npol=2 + plasma path. `examples` 20/20,
   `sim-multimode` 41/41; the corrected example also completed end-to-end
   at a shortened 5 mm length.
4. 🟢 **Prebuilt release installation — local fix DONE 2026-07-25; release
   handling decided.** `deps/build.jl` now tries the canonical
   `libamalthea-<triple>` asset first and falls back to the legacy
   `libluna_rust-<triple>` name *only* for versions ≤ `v1.0.0`, so a future
   genuinely-broken release cannot be masked. Verified against the real
   published `v1.0.0` (download + checksum + install) and by a 4-scenario
   local-HTTP fixture suite (20/20). `release.yml` already stages canonical
   names for future tags — unchanged. **Lead's decision: leave `v1.0.0`'s
   published assets untouched and prepare a `v1.0.1` instead** (see the new
   item below); no release asset was mutated.
   🔴→🟢 **Regression on the very next push, fixed 2026-07-26.** With the
   fallback in place, CI itself downloaded the stale `v1.0.0` binary over the
   library it had just built and every job in both workflows died with
   `undefined symbol: native_compute_extra_stages` (the S5.3 dense-output FFI
   symbol, added after the tag). Root cause is the version keying, not the
   name matching: `Project.toml` still reads `1.0.0` while `main`'s sources
   are far ahead of it. `deps/build.jl` now refuses the download entirely for
   a source checkout (`_is_source_checkout()`, `.git` present — registered
   `Pkg.add` installs keep the fast path), and both workflows set
   `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` at workflow level. **Closed
   2026-07-28:** immediately after tagging `v1.0.1`, `main` moved to
   `Project.toml` version `1.0.2-DEV` (and Python `1.0.2.dev0`), so source
   tarballs no longer identify themselves as the preceding release. See
   `docs/dev/native-port/portlog-inbox/prebuilt-asset-compat.md` §7.
5. ⚪ **Short-kernel Raman convolution — measured 2026-07-25, RECOMMEND
   AGAINST, closed.** This **reverses Phase J.6(c)'s prior "recommend"**,
   whose premise was an unmeasured guess. `PLANS.md` §6.3 assumed the SiO2
   response decays within ~100fs / 5-10% of the padded grid; the real
   Hollenbeck & Cantrell support at an f64-noise cutoff is **~4.15ps ≈ 76-86%
   of `n_time_over`** — about 40× longer. Isolated speedup is **0.98× (i.e.
   slower)** at the repo's real config (n_time_over=4096: the natural
   `n_time_over+M` length isn't a power of two and FFTW's mixed-radix penalty
   erases the gain), reaching 2.1× only at sizes no config here uses.
   Projected end-to-end ~0.99-1.05× against the >1.4× S5.1 gate. Correctness
   was never the blocker (truncation error 1.7e-16-3.4e-14, inside the
   existing tier). Bench and profiling reverted per S1.6/S5.1 discipline.

### New items raised by the 2026-07-26 CI repair

11. 🟢 **macOS CI `Bus error: 10` — FIXED and repeatedly verified
    2026-07-27.** `physics -
    macos-latest` died with `signal 10 (1): Bus error: 10`, "in expression
    starting at `test/test_rk45.jl:64`", in **2 of 3** runs on 2026-07-26
    (fail `30209977981`, pass `30210333905`, fail `30212265976`). Same file,
    same line, no Julia backtrace printed, always mid-solve (~11-13 % of the
    way in, after ~1650-1900 steps).

    **The most important fact: line 64 is `RK45.solve(f!, ...)` — the plain,
    *non-preconditioned* Julia stepper.** `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` is only
    wired at `solve_precon`, and this testitem's `f!`/`fnl!` are pure Julia
    closures over `FFTW.plan_fft!`/`plan_ifft!`. So no `RustNativeStepper`,
    no FFI, no `libamalthea` code runs in the crashing call. Do not start
    this investigation in the native port.

    Not introduced by the 2026-07-26 CI repair: that changed only which
    library CI builds (source vs stale release asset) and a Python skip
    guard, neither of which this code path touches. It was *masked* before —
    on 2026-07-25 the whole suite died earlier at `undefined symbol`, and the
    last macOS-green run was 2026-07-23. Which leaves the change in the
    environment (macos-latest image, Julia '1' point release) or a
    long-standing rare race that only now got sampled.

    Leads, in order: (a) the restored `julia-actions/cache` carried
    `lunacache/FFTW*wisdom` between runs and its key does not distinguish
    Apple Silicon generations — wisdom recorded on one CPU replayed on
    another is a classic SIGBUS source, and the crash logs do show "Found
    FFTW wisdom at …" immediately before; (b) in-place `FFT*out`/`IFT*out`
    plans applied to a buffer whose alignment differs from the planned one;
    (c) genuine memory corruption elsewhere in the physics group that only
    lands here. The bounded first mitigation in
    `.github/workflows/run_tests.yml`: retain package caching everywhere,
    but set `cache-scratchspaces: false` only for the macOS physics matrix
    entry so CPU-specific FFTW wisdom cannot be restored across runners —
    was **not sufficient**. Branch run `30291822719`, job `90063141471`
    created fresh host-local wisdom and still crashed at 94.68% / 20,541
    steps. The next bounded change extends `test/runtests.jl`'s existing
    Windows-only `set_fftw_threads(1)` guard to macOS: the job uses
    `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=auto`, which otherwise makes Amalthea request 12 FFTW
    threads for this repeatedly-executed 1024-point in-place transform.
    Julia threads remain enabled and production defaults are unchanged.
    Branch run `30293434654` passed the full 16-job matrix; its macOS physics
    job then passed three consecutive executions on commit `3c3eadf`:
    attempt 1 job `90068647392` (6m07s), attempt 2 job `90074181421`
    (6m06s), and attempt 3 job `90075895290` (6m25s). This closes the
    reproducing 2-of-3 failure. If it ever recurs, test explicit
    `FFTW.UNALIGNED` plans next, then prior memory corruption.

### New items raised by the 2026-07-25 wave

6. 🟢 **`TransModal` `DimensionMismatch` for `full=true` + npol=2 + plasma —
   FIXED 2026-07-27.** The initial diagnosis was wrong: Cubature merely
   rethrew the nonlinear callback's exception. The example passed a vector
   example field to `PlasmaCumtrapz`, which therefore allocated vector
   `P`/`J`/phase buffers, while the `components=:xy` transform passed an N×2
   `Et`. The example now constructs the response with
   `zeros(length(grid.to), 2)`; `PlasmaCumtrapz` checks its stored buffer
   shape and emits a focused constructor diagnostic; and
   `test/test_transmodal_vector_plasma.jl` proves both the diagnostic and a
   finite, nonzero full=true/npol=2/plasma transform whose plasma control
   effect exceeds 1e-8. Focused test 8/8, `sim-multimode` 41/41, and the
   corrected shortened end-to-end example completed in 39 accepted steps.
7. 🟢 **Prepare and publish `v1.0.1` — RELEASED 2026-07-28.** Release commit
   `b991d7c` passed the 16/16-job test matrix (`30360587278`) and
   documentation (`30360585023`) before tagging. Release workflow
   `30379620216` built and published canonical Linux x86_64, Apple Silicon,
   and Windows x86_64 `libamalthea-*` assets. The initially assembled
   checksum manifest exposed a Windows formatting defect (single separator
   space plus CRLF): the Julia installer's whitespace parser accepted it,
   but GNU `sha256sum -c` skipped that line. The published manifest was
   replaced with a two-space/LF form verified against all three downloaded
   binaries, and `release.yml` now generates that portable form directly.
   Release: <https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl/releases/tag/v1.0.1>.
8. 🟢 **GPU adaptive error estimate — FIXED and hardware-verified
   2026-07-27.** `CudaNativeSim::step` now forms the fifth-order trial in
   `ystage_d` before acceptance, evaluates the norm against old+trial, and
   only propagates/swaps the trial into `field_d` when accepted; rejection
   leaves the resident field bit-exact. Tracing the placeholder found two
   further defects in the same block: the CUDA kernel implemented an
   elementwise `normnorm`-style expression rather than Julia/Rust's global
   `weaknorm`, and its reduction took a **maximum**, not a sum. The GPU now
   reduces `Σ|yerr|²`, `Σ|y0|²`, and `Σ|y1|²` and assembles the exact CPU
   formula. On the RTX 5060 Ti, Kerr and Kerr+PPT both deliberately reject,
   preserve state, retry, and complete adaptive trajectories within
   `5.42e-15` / `2.24e-15` of CPU native; fixed-step `err` matches the Julia
   oracle to ~`3e-15` relative. Focused CUDA test 59/59.
12. 🟢 **Parallelize GPU PPT cumulative integrals — DONE and
   hardware-verified 2026-07-27.** Replaced the three one-thread scans with
   deterministic two-level 256-sample Blelloch scans plus parallel physics
   finalizers. A direct 513-sample Rust/CUDA test covers block offsets and a
   partial final block. Same-hardware fixed-step benchmark (minimum of three
   five-step batches): old→new GPU time is 75.82→1.520 ms/step at
   `n_time_over=8192`, 153.92→2.121 at 16384, and 321.02→1.559 at 32768.
   The new GPU/CPU speed is 0.82×, 1.08×, and 2.94× respectively, so `:auto`
   now admits supported PPT configs at
   `_GPU_PPT_N_THRESHOLD=8192` (`length(Eω)`), with margin above the
   marginal n=4097 crossover. The explicit
   `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` master opt-in remains mandatory.
9. 🟢 **`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` process-wide silently reroutes CPU-native
   equivalence tests onto the GPU — FIXED and verified on hardware
   2026-07-26.** The five vulnerable files (`test_native_phase1.jl`,
   `test_native_phase2.jl`, `test_native_phase8.jl`,
   `test_native_fftw_wisdom.jl`, `test_native_dense_order5.jl`) now pin
   `withenv("AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU" => "off")` around every `RustNativeStepper`
   construction and assert the choice with a counted
   `@test !RK45._gpu_native_eligible(...)`. Measured on the RTX 5060 Ti: the
   full `rust` group under `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1
   AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` is **42269 pass / 1 broken / 0 failures** (the 18
   failures it replaces are agent-measured, matching the count recorded
   independently on 2026-07-25; only this post-fix state was lead-verified),
   and the default-env run has **identical totals** — proving no
   test was disabled — while the GPU tests still execute on the GPU. Two extra
   instances the original count missed: `test_native_phase8.jl` was passing
   only by tolerance luck (1.7e-9 vs an expected ~1.6e-11, under a loose 1e-8
   bound) and `test_native_dense_order5.jl`'s GPU testitem was comparing GPU
   against GPU. Record:
   `docs/dev/native-port/portlog-inbox/gpu-env-pinning.md`. Original report
   below.
   Found 2026-07-25 while
   verifying item 1: running the whole `rust` group with
   `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1 AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` produces **18
   failures** (`test_native_phase1.jl` 6, `test_native_fftw_wisdom.jl` 3,
   `test_native_phase2.jl` 1, and others), while the same tree under the
   default env is fully green (7-group gate exit 0, `rust` 42247/42248).
   Cause: those tests construct a `RustNativeStepper` and assert CPU-native
   tolerance tiers, but have no `withenv` guard pinning the backend — `on`
   bypasses the `:auto` size/shape dispatch that normally protects them.
   Only `test_native_cuda.jl` sets its backend explicitly. **Not a
   regression from the 2026-07-25 wave and not a GPU-correctness problem**
   (`test_native_cuda.jl` passes 31/31 under exactly that env), but it makes
   "run the suite on the GPU" quietly unusable as a verification technique.
   Fix by pinning `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=off` (or asserting the chosen
   backend) in the CPU-native phase tests.
10. 🟢 **Test discovery recurses into `.claude/worktrees/` — FIXED
    2026-07-26.** `test/runtests.jl` now filters out any test item whose file
    lives under a `.claude` path component (matched via
    `splitpath(relpath(...))`, not a bare substring, so a checkout path that
    merely contains the string ".claude" can't misfire), in both the `All`
    branch and the tagged branch — the `All` branch previously ran
    `@run_package_tests` with no filter at all. `amalthea/tests/*.jl` (the
    auto-discovered half of the `rust` safety net, `CLAUDE.md`/this file
    line ~1182) has no `.claude` path component and stays discovered.
    **No leftover worktrees existed to reproduce with, so the confounder was
    constructed by hand:** a throwaway `.claude/worktrees/fake/test/`
    holding one copy of `test_noise.jl` (`:fields`). Measured on the
    `fields` group: **432/432 with the fix reverted** (334 baseline + 98 from
    the duplicated file) vs. **334/334 with the fix applied**, confounder
    still present — matching the documented `fields` baseline exactly. The
    throwaway directory was then deleted (`git status` clean of it, never
    `git add`ed) and a final clean-tree run reconfirmed **334/334**.
    **Provenance (per the item-9 convention):** the two confounder-present
    numbers (432/432, 334/334) are **agent-measured**; the lead independently
    re-ran the clean tree and confirms **334/334 in 2m37.6s** — which is the
    number the before/after pair is meaningful relative to. Checked
    the parallel/gate path too (`test/parallel_group_tests.py`,
    `test/run_full_gate.py`): `discover_group_files()` uses a **non-recursive**
    `TEST_DIR.glob("*.jl")` scoped to `test/`, so it can never see
    `.claude/worktrees/.../test/*.jl` — not affected. Its worker subprocess
    (`test/run_group_bucket.jl`) does call `@run_package_tests` and re-walks
    the repo, but already carries its own `in_this_checkout` guard (commit
    `fe08fa9`, predating this fix) — so only the plain serial
    `test/runtests.jl` entry point (the one `AGENTS.md` §3 step 5 tells
    every agent to run) had the gap. No changes needed to either Python
    script. Record: `docs/dev/native-port/portlog-inbox/test-discovery-worktree-exclusion.md`.
    **Separate discrepancy surfaced while verifying this, NOT fixed here and
    not the one §5 documents:** the two guards are not the same predicate.
    `run_group_bucket.jl`'s is `dirname(abspath(f)) == THIS_TEST_DIR` (exact
    directory), while `runtests.jl`'s new one only excludes `.claude`
    components — so the serial path discovers the four `tags=[:rust]`
    `@testitem`s in `amalthea/tests/` (`test_julia_ffi.jl`,
    `test_stepper_dispatch.jl`, `test_scans_io.jl`, `test_gpu_cuda.jl`) and
    the parallel/gate path does not. `VANILLA_LUNA_ISSUES.md` §5's
    "one-shared-process vs many-processes" caveat is about the **FFTW
    wisdom pool-channel** delta (42104 vs 42087), a different cause — it
    does not cover this file-set divergence. So serial and parallel `rust`
    counts still legitimately differ, for two independent reasons rather
    than one. Worth reconciling if `rust` counts are ever compared across
    the two entry points; harmless otherwise, and pre-existing.
    Original report below.
    Running a test
    group from the repo root while agent worktrees exist inflates counts —
    `@run_package_tests` finds each nested worktree's copy of every test
    file. Measured 2026-07-25: the `examples` group reported **120/120** from
    the root versus the true **20/20** in a clean worktree. Harmless to
    correctness (everything passes either way) but it makes assertion counts
    meaningless as a regression signal, which this backlog relies on
    throughout. Either prune stale worktrees before gating, run the gate from
    inside a worktree, or exclude `.claude/` from discovery.

### New items raised by the 2026-07-28 backlog review

13. 🟢 **Harden the CUDA backend's field-transfer FFI contract — DONE
    2026-07-28.**
    `CpuNativeSim::{set_field,resync_field,get_field,get_ks_stage}` validates
    null pointers, `n == sim.n`, and the stage index before constructing a
    slice. The corresponding `CudaNativeSim` methods
    (`amalthea/src/cuda_native.rs:636-689`) construct host slices without the
    null/length guards and call GPU copies with `.unwrap()`. Oversized copies
    then hit `GpuBuffer`'s `assert!(bytes <= self.size)`
    (`amalthea/src/cuda.rs:695-713`); null input reaches
    `slice::from_raw_parts`/`from_raw_parts_mut`. This violates the shared
    FFI documentation's “return `-1` on null/length mismatch” contract and can
    abort or enter undefined behavior instead of reporting an error. Add the
    same guards as CPU before any slice construction, replace copy
    assertions/unwraps with returned errors at FFI-reachable seams, and run
    the lifecycle mismatch tests against a real `CudaNativeSim` as well as
    `CpuNativeSim`. Implemented exactly at that boundary: all four CUDA field
    methods reject null/length/index errors before constructing slices,
    transfer failures return `-1`, and `GpuBuffer` reports oversize copies as
    `Err` instead of panicking. The new real-hardware invalid-argument and
    valid round-trip regression passed inside strict `cargo test` (73/73).
14. 🟢 **Re-enable and resolve GPU dense-output convergence coverage — DONE
    2026-07-28, with the support claim narrowed to order 4.**
    `test/test_native_dense_order5.jl:438-449` still skips the GPU convergence
    assertion because the old backend had no nonlinear RHS. That premise was
    fixed on 2026-07-25, but a real-hardware focused run on 2026-07-28 still
    reports **40 pass / 1 broken** from this stale unconditional skip.
    `CudaNativeSim` also still inherits the default
    `compute_extra_stages -> -1`, so GPU interpolation deliberately falls
    back to the order-4 extension while the Julia and CPU-native steppers use
    order 5; this conflicts with the S5.3 status claim that order-5 dense
    output covers all geometries. First replace the stale skip with a
    non-vacuous measured-order test now that `max|kᵢ|` is physical, then
    either implement the two extra stages on CUDA or explicitly narrow the
    S5.3 support/status claim and keep the measured order-4 fallback.
    The stale skip is now a non-vacuous real-hardware convergence test against
    a fine CPU-native order-5 reference. Measured local defects were
    `9.57e-7`, `3.22e-8`, and `1.02e-9` for `h=0.04,0.02,0.01`, giving
    ratios **29.77 and 31.43** (the expected order-4 local ratio is 32).
    CUDA therefore retains the correct order-4 fallback; fifth-order CUDA
    interpolation remains an optional future expansion, not a current
    support claim. Focused strict CUDA+dense/dispatch suite: 104/104, no
    broken tests.
15. 🟢 **Make serial CI and the local parallel/full gate use one test
    manifest — DONE 2026-07-28.** Serial `test/runtests.jl` recursively discovers four
    `tags=[:rust]` files under `amalthea/tests/`, while
    `parallel_group_tests.py::discover_group_files` scans only
    `test/*.jl` and `run_group_bucket.jl` rejects any file outside that exact
    directory. Consequently `python3 test/run_full_gate.py` omits
    `test_julia_ffi.jl`, `test_stepper_dispatch.jl`, `test_scans_io.jl`, and
    `test_gpu_cuda.jl` even though project documentation calls them part of
    the Rust safety net. The local “full” gate also omits the maintained
    `examples` group by design. Define one explicit discovery manifest/root
    set shared by serial and bucketed runners, add a meta-test comparing
    their file sets, and decide whether the default full gate should include
    `examples` or be renamed to make its narrower scope unmistakable.
    `test/test_roots.txt` now defines the two maintained roots for both Julia
    and Python. Bucket identities are repository-relative outside `test/`, so
    the four `amalthea/tests` files are scheduled without basename aliasing,
    while existing timing keys remain valid. A Rust-tagged meta-test compares
    the independently enumerated Julia set with Python's `--list-files`
    output, and a focused mixed-root bucket passed 3/3. The “full” gate now
    includes `examples` and is documented as eight maintained groups.
16. 🟢 **Preserve global scan indices in `RangeExec` — DONE 2026-07-28.**
    `Scans.runscan(::Scan{RangeExec})` enumerates
    `combos[scan.exec.r]`, which restarts `scanidx` at 1 instead of retaining
    the selected points' original linear indices. A focused
    `RangeExec(3:4)` reproduction returned `[(1, 30), (2, 40)]`, not
    `[(3, 30), (4, 40)]`. Existing coverage uses only `1:6`, so it cannot
    expose the offset. Callbacks commonly use `scanidx` for filenames,
    `getvalue`, and save locations; separate range workers can therefore
    label or overwrite another chunk's results. Iterate the requested
    indices themselves (`for scanidx in scan.exec.r; args = combos[scanidx]`)
    and add a non-1-based range regression covering both callback indices and
    output isolation. The implementation now iterates the original indices;
    the `3:4` regression returns `[(3,30),(4,40)]`.
17. 🟢 **Fix the non-terminating `Output.always` save condition — DONE
    2026-07-28.** Both
    `MemoryOutput` and `HDF5Output` repeatedly call their save condition
    inside `while save`, incrementing `saved` each time. `Output.always`
    returns `(true, t)` for every `saved` value, so one output callback loops
    forever: memory output grows without bound and HDF5 output continuously
    extends/writes its datasets. No test or in-tree call site covers this
    exported condition. The built-in native-point predicates now emit at most
    one sample per accepted-step callback, while `GridCondition` and custom
    predicates retain the historical repeated-evaluation contract. This also
    fixes `every_nth`, whose closure counter was previously advanced repeatedly
    inside one callback. Memory/HDF5 `always`, `every_nth`, and grid catch-up
    regressions all pass.
18. 🟢 **Correct Fourier edge-bin handling in `Maths.hilbert` and real
    `Maths.oversample` — DONE 2026-07-28.** The direct and planned Hilbert implementations use
    the same even/odd mask: for even lengths they zero the Nyquist bin (which
    must be retained), and for odd lengths they also zero the highest
    positive-frequency bin (which must be doubled). Focused N=8/N=9
    edge-frequency signals both returned an analytic-signal norm effectively
    zero and a real-part relative error of 1.0. Separately, real oversampling
    copies an even-length input's unique Nyquist coefficient into an interior
    bin without halving it; an N=8 Nyquist-only signal sampled back from a
    4× oversample was exactly 2× the input. Add parity-specific edge-bin tests
    for `hilbert`, `plan_hilbert!`, and `oversample`, then implement the
    standard even/odd FFT masks and Nyquist split. Direct and planned
    transforms now share one parity-correct mask, and even-length real
    oversampling halves the relocated Nyquist coefficient. The N=8/N=9 edge
    regressions and Nyquist round trip pass.
19. 🟢 **Honor the `shape` keyword in `Tools.getN` — DONE 2026-07-28.** The public function
    accepts `shape=:sech|:gauss`, and `Lfiss` forwards its own `shape`, but
    `getN` hardcodes `Ld(..., shape=:sech)`. A focused calculation produced
    identical soliton order for `:gauss` and `:sech`
    (`2.0341464055716445`) instead of the Gaussian value
    `2.1534237994413084`. Pass the caller's keyword through and add direct
    `getN`/`Lfiss` tests for both pulse shapes; separately decide whether
    `E_to_P0`/`params` should continue rejecting Gaussian pulses or gain the
    corresponding energy-to-peak-power formula. `getN` now forwards the
    keyword and both defining-formula regressions pass. The deliberately
    separate `E_to_P0` policy was not broadened.

20. 🟢 **Make coverage assignment and load balancing identical locally and
    in GitHub Actions — DONE 2026-07-28.** The eight maintained groups
    currently cover every executable `@testitem`, but only the Rust group's
    serial/parallel file set has a regression guard. The workflow still runs
    every group in one serial Julia process, so the 2026-07-28 `main` run was
    gated by `sim-interface` (22m48s) and Linux `rust` (21m16s), while several
    jobs finished in 5-10 minutes. Local LPT balancing is not yet reused by
    CI, its timing data is missing 15 Rust files, the new multimode-plasma
    file, and the examples file, and timing refreshes cannot safely name log
    files for secondary-root identities containing `/`. The bucket runner
    also omits the Windows/macOS one-thread FFTW guard from `runtests.jl`.
    Define the maintained group list once; guard every discovered test item,
    every group, workflow inclusion, and timing coverage; schedule individual
    test items so the monolithic interface suite can be divided; carry the
    platform safety setup into bucket workers; and invoke the same bounded
    LPT runner from GitHub Actions. Keep macOS physics serial because of the
    historical SIGBUS, and do not weaken or remove any test to improve time.
    The two current macOS annotations are unrelated runner-image noise:
    Rust setup invokes `brew install bash`, and Homebrew ignores GitHub's
    unused, untrusted `aws/tap`; both jobs pass, so trusting the tap or
    disabling Homebrew's trust check is explicitly out of scope.
    `test/test_groups.txt` now owns the group list, and the expanded
    337-assertion manifest meta-test independently checks every executable
    test item's assignment, Python discovery, workflow inclusion, external
    CUDA test, and exact-or-legacy timing coverage. All 112 scheduled item
    memberships have timings. The scheduler can address individual
    `file::item` identities, uses collision-safe log names, and refuses to
    publish a partial timing refresh; the monolithic interface item is split
    into seven unchanged assertion units. Local batches cap their combined
    worker count at 10, while GitHub uses two workers on Linux/Windows and one
    for macOS/examples. Bucket workers now mirror platform FFTW/HDF5 setup,
    and CI mode preserves the replaced action's bounds, deprecation,
    compiled-module, inlining, and user-coverage flags with a distinct LCOV
    trace per worker. Strict two-worker Rust passed 42640/42640 in 434.0s
    (22.7% below the prior 561.6s strict serial gate); interface passed
    314/314 in 217.9s. Physics, multimode, propagation, I/O, fields, and
    examples also passed through the new scheduler. The first pushed Actions
    run remains the authoritative hosted-runner timing comparison.
    **2026-07-29 first-push regression:** both Windows jobs failed before
    launching Julia tests because Python decoded UTF-8 Julia sources with the
    host CP-1252 default (`UnicodeDecodeError`, byte `0x81`). The bounded fix
    makes UTF-8 explicit for scheduler manifests, source declarations,
    timings, group lists, and worker-log parsing. The subsequent hosted Rust
    trace exposed CRLF retained by the Julia meta-test when it split Python
    stdout on bare `\n`; it now uses `readlines(IOBuffer(...))` and directly
    regresses synthetic CRLF. Failed worker logs are also copied into durable
    Actions output with console-safe escaping. CI workers now print their
    assigned items before launch and emit one-minute flushed heartbeats with
    elapsed time, log size, and the latest available log line, so a long
    parallel bucket is no longer opaque. A 12-test scheduler unit suite and
    the 337-assertion manifest meta-test pass locally. Hosted run
    `30503817234` passed all **16/16** jobs: Windows physics and Rust are green,
    Windows Rust passed **42569/42569**, and its retained log proves assignments
    were flushed before launch followed by one-minute live heartbeats. This
    first-push portability/visibility follow-up is closed.
    **2026-08-02 post-merge precompile-race follow-up:** main push run
    `30759899291` failed only in the two-worker Linux `fields` job. Worker 0
    passed 204/204; worker 1 exited before test discovery while both fresh
    Julia processes compiled the shared depot, with `DSP → OffsetArraysExt`
    failing inside `_include_from_serialized` (`ArgumentError: No value
    arguments present`). The pull-request run and every other push job passed,
    so this is worker bootstrap concurrency rather than a fields/Luna
    regression. Before launching a parallel bucket, the shared scheduler now
    runs one serial Julia preflight that loads the same `TestItemRunner` and
    `Amalthea` modules as `run_group_bucket.jl`. A failed preflight must emit
    its complete log and abort; a successful one populates the shared compiled
    cache before worker fan-out. Keep this in the scheduler so local cold-depot
    runs receive the same protection as GitHub Actions. The scheduler unit
    suite passes **14/14**, and the exact local two-worker `fields --ci` path
    passes **339/339** (worker 0: 204/204; worker 1: 135/135) after the serial
    preflight, with no concurrent package-precompile activity.

Explicitly parked, and therefore **not** resume points without a new user need:
multi-mode `StepIndexMode` (no consumer), the full SoA conversion (~1% ceiling),
the cold-start standalone CLI (porting all Julia setup has negative ROI), and
direct PPT/direct-error-coefficient rewrites (premises did not survive study).

## Completed work — status index

Full narrative for everything below lives in
[`ARCHIVE.md`](ARCHIVE.md); section names there are unchanged, so a source
comment citing "Phase E.3" or "S1 item 6" still resolves. The remainder list
below preserves each item's disposition; only entries explicitly marked open
are live.

### Improvement plan (2026-07-02 review) — Phases A-J

Phased plan from the fork-vs-upstream review ([`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) —
fully executed, kept as provenance). Gate for every phase: full
`LUNA_TEST_GROUP=All` suite green.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Upstream sync (#428 ellipse angle, #427 SSHExec `files`, `upstream_sync.yml`) | ✅ |
| B | Correctness & parity (`_safe_n`, Rust `Emax` clamp, density z-independence guard) | ✅ |
| C | Make the default workload actually native (decouple the ionisation LUT from its opt-in toggle) | ✅ |
| D | Native scope: EnvGrid + plasma/Raman in more geometries | ✅ |
| E | Native scope: modal generality (`full=true`, TE/TM/`n>1`, npol=2, tapered radius) | ✅ |
| F | Native scope: Raman completions (`thg=false`, `RamanPolarEnv`) + z-dependence | ✅ |
| G | Platform & CI robustness (Windows scan lock, CI benchmark job) | ✅ except GPU CI — see "GPU CI coverage" under Open items |
| H | Upstream contributions | 3 of 4 sent; `pointcalc!` race fix not actionable (upstream doesn't thread it) |
| I | Close remaining native-port gaps (incl. the 🔴🔴 missing plasma density factor) | ✅ except deliberately parked I.5b (`StepIndexMode`) |
| J | Post-completion audit (2026-07-08) | ✅ all items closed; J.6(c) measured and rejected 2026-07-25 |

### Suggestions backlog — closed tracks

| Track | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Hot-loop CPU performance (FFTW wisdom, fused RK45 accumulation, de-branched Kerr, BLAS-3 QDHT, SoA spike) | ✅ all 6 items resolved or deliberately parked |
| S2 | Threading the native RHS (radial, modal, free-space) | ✅ closed 2026-07-22 |
| S4 | Architecture cleanups (`BackendConfig`, `RK45.check_ffi`, explicit accessor seams) | ✅ gate closed 2026-07-11 |
| S5 | Numerics options (mixed precision, deterministic mode, order-5 dense output) | ✅ all 3 items resolved, closed 2026-07-23 |
| 2026-07-31 campaign | RK45 correctness, FFI/CUDA transaction safety, CI policy/strict PTX, mode-averaged thresholded ADK | ✅ complete; ADK `:auto` threshold retained at 8193 |

S3 and the release/example remainders of S6 stay live below; S2 closed
2026-07-22 and S5 on 2026-07-23.

### Remainders lifted out of the archived phases

1. 🟢 **Phase I.5a — `ZeisbergerMode`/`VincettiMode` multi-mode: native Rust
   port done (2026-07-22).** `RK45.jl`'s native modal guard now accepts both
   wrapper types — it unwraps to the inner `Capillary.MarcatiliMode` for the
   accessor fields the guard/setup read as raw struct fields (`kind`/`a`/
   `unm`/`ϕ`/`n`); `field`/`N` already delegate through generic dispatch. No
   `native.rs` change was needed: the native modal RHS never reads
   `neff`/dispersion, only the pre-baked `linop` (built by Julia before the
   RHS runs) and Marcatili field-synthesis parameters. `test/test_native_modal_zv.jl`
   (single-step 6e-18/exact, full-solve 3.5e-16/2.6e-15). See ARCHIVE.md
   Phase I item 5.
1b. 🟡 **Phase I.5b — `StepIndexMode` multi-mode: still native-ineligible.**
   No closed-form `neff` (numerical root-finding only), so it can't cheaply
   join the "bake dispersion into `linop`, unwrap for the field-synthesis
   accessors" pattern I.5a uses. Feasibility studied 2026-07-22 and found
   bounded but not currently worth building (no consumer constructs this
   config) — full design record and the exact narrow scope for a future
   implementer in [`native-port/PLANS.md`](native-port/PLANS.md) §5.
2. 🟢 **Phase J.3 — r2c/c2r halving for both FFT-conv Raman convolutions:
   done 2026-07-22, measured, bar cleared, kept.** Criterion spike
   (`amalthea/benches/raman_fft_r2c_bench.rs`) measured 1.8–2.8× across
   n_time_over=1024..65536 (~2.2× at the real `:SiO2` config's grid size).
   Implemented in both the native `:SiO2` kernel and Julia's `RamanPolarEnv`
   together, keeping the equivalence tier r2c-vs-r2c. `test/test_native_raman_sio2.jl`
   40/40 (native-vs-Julia 1.8e-13–3.6e-13).
3. 🟢 **Phase J.5 — consolidate the two resident Raman kernels' plumbing:
   done 2026-07-22, alongside J.3.** Extracted the duplicated `0.5·|E|²`
   intensity and `pto += E·(ρ·P)` accumulation loops (Steps 3b/3c in
   `rhs_mode_avg_env`) into shared free functions — pure code motion, no
   numerical change.
4. 🟢 **Phase J.6 — beyond-Luna math options, closed.** Feasibility studied
   2026-07-22 (full write-up in [`native-port/PLANS.md`](native-port/PLANS.md)
   §6): (a) direct DP5(4) error coefficients — **recommend against**, both
   backends already precompute `errest = b5.-b4` at load, so the premise's
   runtime cancellation doesn't exist; (b) direct PPT evaluation — **recommend
   against**, the true series has a BigFloat-quadrature tail that can't live
   in a hot loop and the LUT error is already below physical significance;
   (c) short-kernel Raman pad-shortening — **recommend against after
   measurement**: the response support is 76-86% of `n_time_over`, the real
   n=4096 configuration measured 0.98×, and projected end-to-end improvement
   was ~0.99-1.05×, below the >1.4× gate. The prototype was reverted.
5. 🟢 **Phase S5.3 — order-5 dense-output continuous extension: done
   2026-07-23 for Julia and CPU-native backends.** The
   Calvo-Montijano-Rández (1990) order-5 tableau, wired into those two
   steppers (extra-stage FFI + shared `interpC5`/
   `_dp5_extra_stages!` helpers). The 2026-07-22 attempt's blocker — order-4
   *and* order-5 interpolants both degrading as O(h²) — was **not** a test
   artifact: `step!` performed the FSAL carry k7→k1 at accept time, so
   `interpolate` was handed k7 in place of the finished interval's k1 and
   the continuous extension collapsed to first order. Inherited from
   upstream Luna and re-ported into all three Rust steppers; fixed in all
   four by deferring the carry to the top of the next step. CUDA does not
   implement the two extra stages and deliberately retains its measured,
   correct order-4 fallback (item 14 above). The WIP's test
   additionally ran at h=2e-3, where the order-5 defect is already at the FP
   floor and no ratio means anything. Full postmortem, tableau provenance
   and measured orders: `native-port/portlog-inbox/dense-order5.md`.

## Suggestions backlog (imported from SUGGESTIONS.md, 2026-07-07)

Full detail (equations, rationale, per-item code sketches) stays in
`SUGGESTIONS.md` — this is the tracking summary, synced so status lives in
one place. S1, S2, S4 and S5 are now closed (S2 on 2026-07-22, S5 on
2026-07-23). S6's HDF5 writer and release machinery are implemented; its
cold-start CLI was studied and parked, while the v1.0.0 asset-name repair and
example repairs are complete; the v1.0.1 release remains in the queue above.
S1.5's BLAS-3 correctness
bug was fixed; the path remains opt-in because its ≥1.5× default-flip
benchmark was never demonstrated. **S3 is partially implemented and its
landed narrow slice is hardware-verified, but still lacks standing GPU CI**
(items 0 and 2 below):
the GPU-resident stepper work landed 2026-07-05/07 (see Phase G's "Open
items" entry and ARCHIVE.md's "Done (recent)") implements a narrow slice of S3
(mode-averaged RealGrid Kerr-only, no threading/dispatch-threshold/design
doc) — and did so *before* the GPU CI dependency S3 itself declares
("needs a CUDA machine... do NOT start before [GPU CI] exists, or it will
rot"), which is exactly what happened once already (uncommitted 2 days,
found broken until manually re-verified). GPU CI is still open (see "GPU
CI coverage" below) — treat S3's remaining scope (design doc, full
`NativeBackend` parity, threading, dispatch threshold, `test_native_gpu.jl`)
as still gated on it. **Update 2026-07-25:** the zero-nonlinearity defect
found on 2026-07-23 is fixed and non-vacuously hardware-verified; the episode
is why every future GPU change requires either standing CI or a recorded
manual hardware run.

**ISA / hardware dispatch — synced to actual code state (2026-07-07):**
`dispatch.rs`'s hardware cascade (CUDA → Vulkan → AVX-512 → AVX2 → NEON →
Apple AMX → portable) is real for *detection and selection*
(`is_x86_feature_detected!`, `dlopen`-based Vulkan/CUDA probes all
genuinely check the running machine). But grepping `amalthea/src/` for
`target_feature`/`_mm256_`/`_mm512_`/`std::arch` finds vectorized code in
exactly **one** file: `raman.rs`'s `solve_avx2`. Every other kernel (Kerr,
RK45 stage accumulation, window/norm broadcasts, QDHT) runs the same
portable-scalar code regardless of which `HardwarePath` `dispatch.rs`
selects — so today the dispatcher's choice of AVX-512/AVX2/NEON is
**cosmetic** for everything except Raman. This is suggestion 3 below,
tracked as S1.4; until it lands, "AVX-512 path selected" does not mean
"AVX-512 code ran."

### 🟢 S2 — Threading the native RHS (suggestion 2) — COMPLETE (all 4 items, closed 2026-07-22)
*Started 2026-07-10, reverted same day, root-caused and re-landed
2026-07-11 (radial, items 1-2). Modal (item 3) landed 2026-07-20;
free-space (item 4) landed 2026-07-22 — the whole track is now done. See
`docs/dev/native-port/PLANS.md §3` for the full phased plan.*

**Phase 3 REVERTED 2026-07-10, RE-LANDED 2026-07-11 — root cause was a
missing GC root, not a Rust-side memory-safety bug in the parallel code
itself.** After Phase 3 was committed/pushed (`d15a25c`), a post-hoc
wall-clock benchmark (`bench_threads.jl`-style: `n_threads=1`→4 at N=32
then N=128, plasma enabled throughout, same process) surfaced an
intermittent segfault inside `PptIonizationRate::rate`. The revert
commit's isolation experiment (Kerr-only config never crashed) correctly
implicated `apply_plasma_radial`'s parallel branch, but its diagnosis —
"an out-of-bounds write during the `n_threads=4` plasma call corrupts the
allocator's view of nearby memory" — was wrong about *where* the bug
lived.

**Actual root cause, found 2026-07-11 by installing ASAN
(`rustup +nightly` with `-Z build-std` — plain `-Z sanitizer=address`
silently fails to catch heap corruption on this toolchain because the
prebuilt stdlib allocator shim isn't itself instrumented) and Valgrind,
then reproducing the crash directly:**
- An isolated Rust-only repro of `apply_plasma_radial()` alone (40 varied
  cycles, real ASAN instrumentation) never crashed — ruling out a
  self-contained out-of-bounds write in that function.
- The **full pipeline** (checked out `d15a25c` into a worktree, ran a
  real `RustNativeStepper` radial+plasma solve at `native_threads=4`)
  reproduced a genuine `SIGSEGV` reliably. `coredumpctl`/gdb's backtrace
  showed a rayon worker thread segfaulting *inside*
  `PptIonizationRate::rate()`, called concurrently by multiple worker
  threads via `plasma_rate_at`/`rayon::iter::plumbing::bridge_producer_consumer`.
- Manual review of `CubicSplineLUT::evaluate()`'s binary search and its
  `get_unchecked(low)` call: logically correct and thread-safe as
  written — `low` is provably `< segments.len()` by the search's own
  invariant, and it only reads immutable `&self` data with no interior
  mutability. So the crash meant the `Vec<SplineSegment>`'s own heap
  metadata (pointer/len/capacity) was **already corrupted** before this
  call ran.
- Tracing how `plasma_ion_ptr`/`plasma_adk_ptr` (`*const
  PptIonizationRate`/`*const AdkIonizationRate` in `native.rs`) get set
  found the real defect: `native_set_plasma_params` stores this raw
  pointer *directly*, re-dereferencing it on every future `native_step`
  call for the sim's entire lifetime — unlike every other kernel's
  setup (Raman/dispersion oscillator data), which Rust copies into its
  own `Vec` once and never touches the original pointer again. The
  pointee is Julia-allocated-and-owned: `Ionisation.jl`'s
  `RustIonizationHandle`/`RustAdkHandle` carry a GC finalizer
  (`free_ppt_ionization_lut`/equivalent) that frees the Rust memory.
  `RustNativeStepper` (`RK45.jl`) never stored a Julia-level reference
  to `irf`/`irf.rust_handle` after construction — only the raw pointer
  value crossed the FFI boundary. Since Julia's `ccall` releases the GC
  safepoint for the duration of a foreign call (letting other Julia
  threads/the GC run concurrently, with *no visibility into native Rust
  threads* still holding the pointer), the handle was eligible for GC
  finalization **at any point after construction**, including mid-solve
  while rayon worker threads were still concurrently dereferencing it —
  a textbook FFI use-after-free. Threading only widened the race window
  (longer-lived worker threads doing more concurrent work, more
  allocation pressure to trigger a GC cycle during the window); it did
  not cause the unsoundness — the same latent bug existed on the
  sequential path too, just with a race window too small to observe in
  practice.
- **Fix** (applied to `main` independently of re-landing threading, since
  it's a real latent bug regardless): added a `_gc_roots::Vector{Any}`
  field to `RustNativeStepper` (`RK45.jl`) that the constructor populates
  with every Julia handle object (`irf.rust_handle`) whose raw pointer
  the Rust-side `NativeSim` stores persistently, across all three
  geometries (mode-avg/radial/modal) and both ionization models
  (PPT/ADK) — six call sites total. Nothing reads `_gc_roots`; its only
  job is keeping those objects Julia-reachable for the stepper's whole
  lifetime, preventing early finalization.
- **Verified the fix holds**: re-applied the Phase 3 diff (`fftw.rs`'s
  `unsafe impl Sync`, `native.rs`'s `ReadOnlyPtr`/`plasma_rate_at`/
  parallel FFT-and-plasma branches, `RK45.jl`'s `native_threads` kwarg,
  both bit-identical tests) on top of the GC-root fix, then re-ran the
  exact crash-reproducing script for 8 cycles alternating N=32/N=128 and
  `native_threads` 1/4 with `GC.gc()` forced between every cycle (to
  maximize GC pressure) — all 8 completed cleanly, versus crashing at
  cycle 2 before the fix. `n_threads=1` and `n_threads=4` results were
  bit-identical across every repeated size (confirmed via `yn` norm
  equality, not just non-crashing). Full 7-group gate green (see "Done
  (recent)").
- **Lesson for future FFI kernel wiring**: any `native_set_*_params` call
  that stores a raw pointer into Julia-owned, Rust-allocated memory
  *persistently* (re-dereferenced across multiple future calls, not just
  copied once at setup) needs its Julia-side handle rooted somewhere
  that outlives construction — `RustNativeStepper._gc_roots` is that
  place going forward. Kernels that copy data into their own `Vec` at
  setup time (the common pattern) don't need this.
1. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-10.** `native_set_threads(handle, n)` FFI, wired from
   `Threads.nthreads()`, default 1 (bit-identical to today — verified via
   full 7-group gate, purely additive plumbing, `n_threads` not yet read
   by any RHS code).
2. `rhs_radial`: rayon over radial nodes, each node's own FFTW
   new-array-execute call against one shared plan; one scratch slab per
   rayon worker (never shared — this is precisely the bug the Julia
   `Threads.@threads` `pointcalc!` race had, see Phase B / ARCHIVE.md's "Done (recent)").
   **Re-scoped after investigation:** an Explore survey found the two
   per-column FFT loops and `apply_plasma_radial`'s per-column loop
   already operate on disjoint slices of matrix-shaped
   (`n_time_over*n_r`) buffers, not shared per-call scratch — safe for
   `par_chunks_mut` without new per-worker scratch structures. Only
   `apply_raman_radial`'s single shared `raman_solver` (and, when
   `raman_thg==false`, shared Hilbert scratch) has the genuine
   shared-mutable-state hazard the backlog warns about. **🟢 Done
   2026-07-19 (S2 Phase 4 item 1):** parallelized by partitioning the
   r-columns into ≤`n_threads` *contiguous* groups, each rayon task owning
   its **own cloned `TimeDomainRamanSolver`** and **own Hilbert scratch**
   (no `current_thread_index`, no interior mutability, provably disjoint
   column slices; `solve()` resets oscillator state at entry, so a cloned
   solver is bit-identical to the shared one). No new GC-root hazard — the
   solver is Rust-owned and only *cloned*, not a persistent raw pointer
   into Julia-owned memory (contrast the plasma-pointer UAF fixed on
   `main`). Verified to the full S2 bar: `n_threads=1`-vs-`4`
   **bit-identical** (`s.yn` exact) in `test/test_native_radial_raman.jl`,
   plus an 8-cycle forced-`GC.gc()` stress repro with no crash.
   Modal (item 3) and free-space (item 4) threading remain the open
   follow-ups (the latter needs an isolated multi-threaded FFTW plan under
   `PLANNER_LOCK`: `fftw.rs`'s `unsafe impl Sync` only holds for
   single-threaded plans, so an `nthreads>1` plan would deadlock under the
   existing concurrent `fftw_execute_dft` path).
   **Measured 2026-07-10** (temporary `Instant` profiling, reverted after
   reading, same discipline as S1.6): FFT-loop + plasma-loop share of
   `rhs_radial` time, at N=32/N=128 r-points, with/without plasma:
   | N | plasma | FFT | QDHT | plasma | other |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 32 | off | 35.9% | 46.7% | — | 17.4% |
   | 32 | on | 20.9% | 28.3% | 40.5% | 10.2% |
   | 128 | off | 18.6% | 72.6% | — | 8.8% |
   | 128 | on | 14.1% | 54.8% | 24.5% | 6.6% |

   Unlike S1.6's ~2% ceiling, FFT+plasma combined is **38-61% of
   `rhs_radial` time** for plasma-enabled configs — clears the bar for
   proceeding. QDHT dominates the rest (already internally
   parallel/BLAS-backed via S1 item 5's BLAS-3 QDHT fix — out of scope
   for this item).
3. 🟢 **Modal: DONE 2026-07-20.** rayon over the cubature batch's nodes
   inside both `integrand_v` callbacks (`modal_integrand_v` /
   `modal_integrand_v_full`) — cubature's own adaptive node *placement* stays
   sequential/deterministic; only the per-node integrand evaluation is
   parallelized. **Measured first** (temp `Instant` counters on `rhs_modal`,
   add/measure/revert per S1.6/S2-Phase-2 discipline): the integrand loop is
   **90.3%** (full=false, 1 mode) / **95.6%** (full=true) / **82.8%**
   (2-mode) of `rhs_modal` wall time — well above the proceed bar (radial was
   38-61%; S1.6 parked at ~2%). Batch sizes are small for full=false (~4
   nodes/batch) but each node is ~27-33µs of FFT-heavy work, so threading
   still nets a win; full=true batches ~25 nodes. **Measured wall-clock
   speedup (`native_threads`=1→4, this 12-core host, 300-step fixed-dt solve,
   min-of-3):** full=false 1-mode **1.31×**, full=false 2-mode **1.52×**,
   full=true **2.64×** — every config a genuine speedup (even the small-batch
   full=false regime S3.3/S1.6 warned could go net-negative), which also
   proves the parallel branch actually engages (the bit-identical test isn't
   vacuously passing on a silently-sequential path). No min-npt guard needed.
   **Refactor:**
   `rhs_modal_pointcalc` (a `&mut self` method scribbling on ~13 shared
   `self.modal_*`/`raman_*` scratch buffers) was split into a `Sync`
   read-only view (`ModalRO`: `&[..]`/`Copy`/`Option<&Plan>`, FFT wrappers
   already `Sync`) + per-worker `ModalScratch` (all written buffers, pooled on
   `self.modal_scratch_pool`, entry 0 = sequential path) and a free-standing
   associated fn `modal_pointcalc(&ro, sc, r, θ, out)` used by BOTH paths (one
   code path, no duplicated 270-line body). Nodes split into `≤ n_threads`
   contiguous groups; each group's `out[p*fdim..]` is disjoint with no
   cross-node reduction ⇒ **bit-identical** `n_threads`=1-vs-4 (the S2 gate,
   not a tolerance). Raman-modal threaded too: each worker's `ModalScratch`
   carries its **own cloned** `TimeDomainRamanSolver` + Hilbert scratch (same
   discipline as radial item 1; `solve()` resets state at entry ⇒ clone ==
   shared, bit-identical); the Hilbert FFT plan is shared read-only
   (`fftw_execute` thread-safe against distinct buffers). No new GC-root
   hazard — the solver is Rust-owned/cloned, not a persistent raw pointer into
   Julia memory (contrast the plasma-pointer UAF fixed on `main`). New
   `test/test_native_modal_threading.jl` (Kerr full=false/full=true/2-mode/
   npol=2, Raman :N2, + forced-`GC.gc()` stress loop): all bit-identical
   1-vs-4, native-vs-Julia unchanged at ~2e-16 (Kerr) / ~1e-6 (Raman ADE-vs-
   FFT floor). 70/70 Rust unit tests; clean `-D warnings` build.
4. 🟢 **3-D free-space FFT: DONE 2026-07-22 — S2 track now fully closed.**
   `fftw_plan_with_nthreads`/`fftw_init_threads` resolved from the *same*
   combined `libfftw3.so` FFTW_jll already ships (no separate
   `libfftw3_threads` needed on this build; silent fallback if a future build
   splits it out). The stated `unsafe impl Sync` blocker dissolved rather
   than needing a workaround: free-space has no per-column loop — the joint
   3-D transform runs once per RK stage from one thread — so `RealFft3d`/
   `ComplexFft3d` never need `Sync` and deliberately don't implement it
   (unlike the 1-D types rayon workers share). Threading is baked into the
   plan via a new `with_nthreads_plan` (symmetric to `with_single_threaded_plan`,
   under `PLANNER_LOCK`, restoring the global planner thread count on exit so
   the 1-D per-column plans stay single-threaded). Measured 2.46–2.51× on the
   isolated transform, 1.43–1.51× end-to-end at every size. `n_threads=1`-vs-`4`
   bit-identical, `test/test_native_free_threading.jl`; `free` group 197/197.
5. 🟢 Error-norm reduction stays sequential (determinism, ties to S5.2) —
   confirmed already sequential (`weaknorm_c64`), untouched by this item.
- Gate: universal + fixed-step equivalence under `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4` +
  ≥2× radial/free benchmark at 4 threads + n=1 bit-identical to pre-track.
  For radial specifically: since the parallelized loops write disjoint
  memory with no cross-column reduction, `n_threads=1` vs. `n_threads=4`
  must be **bit-identical**, not merely within tolerance — a stronger,
  more testable guarantee than typical parallel-code equivalence.

### 🟡 S3 — GPU-resident propagation (suggestion 1) — mode-averaged both-grid Kerr/Raman plus radial RealGrid/EnvGrid scalar Kerr, RealGrid plasma, and radial RealGrid/EnvGrid SDO Raman are supported; broader scope remains unbuilt
*Large (5+ sessions). Plan's own stated dependency (GPU CI) is **still** not
met — see "GPU CI coverage" below, and note that item 0 is precisely what
that gap allowed to happen. This machine has real GPU hardware
(RTX 5060 Ti, driver 610.43.02, CUDA 13.3) usable for manual verification of
future slices, confirmed 2026-07-11, 2026-07-23 and 2026-07-25. On the
sandbox: `nvidia-smi` needed the sandbox disabled in earlier sessions, but
reached the driver directly in the 2026-07-25 agent session — treat this as
environment-dependent, not a fixed rule.*
Already landed (2026-07-05/07, ahead of the plan's own sequencing): the
`NativeBackend` trait extraction, `CudaNativeSim` scoped to mode-averaged
RealGrid Kerr-only (not "+plasma" — see item 1 below, plasma was never
implemented), verified on real hardware, wired behind
`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1`. Still open, per the original design:

0. 🟢 **The GPU-resident RHS contributed no nonlinearity at all — found
   2026-07-23, FIXED and hardware-verified 2026-07-25.** The fix is
   summarized in the resume queue at the top of this file and recorded in
   full in `native-port/portlog-inbox/gpu-nonlinearity.md` + `PORT_LOG.md`.
   It also closes **item 6** below (the `n_time`-vs-`n_time_over` sizing gap,
   which is not separable from Steps 1/5) and fixed a second, undiagnosed
   bug: `CudaNativeSim::set_field` never seeded `ks_d[0]`, so the first
   `step()` read uninitialized device memory. **The diagnosis below is
   retained as-written for provenance — it is what the fix was built from.**
   For the exact config
   `test_native_cuda.jl`'s Kerr-only testitem uses (125µm He capillary,
   1 bar, 800nm, 1µJ, 30fs), the GPU backend's stage derivatives measure
   `max|kᵢ| = 3.5e-13` against the CPU backend's **12225**, and its accepted
   step equals pure linear propagation `exp(L·h)·y₀` to 15 digits — i.e. the
   nonlinear term is absent, not merely inaccurate. Reproduced on real
   hardware (RTX 5060 Ti, driver 610.43.02), and confirmed **pre-existing**
   by re-measuring against a build with the 2026-07-23 `cuda_native.rs`
   changes reverted (identical numbers to the last digit).
   - **Why every GPU test passes anyway:** `test_native_cuda.jl` asserts
     `rel_solve < 1e-3`, but the *entire* nonlinear effect for that config is
     ~4.5e-4 over the solve (1.3e-4 per step). The tolerance is looser than
     the physics being tested, so "GPU matches Julia" is vacuously true —
     the same failure mode as the Phase I plasma-density bug
     (`VANILLA_LUNA_ISSUES.md` §1), where every equivalence test ran in a
     regime where the missing term was negligible.
   - **Not yet diagnosed.** Prime suspects, in order: `set_mode_avg_params`
     discards `pre_re`/`pre_im`/`beta`/`sidx`/`nlscale`/`sqrt_aeff`
     (all `_`-prefixed there) which the mode-averaged RHS needs; the
     `n_time > 0 && fft_r2c != 0 && fft_c2r != 0` guard around the whole
     nonlinear block, which fails *silently* if `cufftPlan1d` fails (its
     return code is discarded); and the `n_time`-vs-`n_time_over` sizing
     mismatch (item 6) feeding the cuFFT plans.
   - **Resume diagnosis (2026-07-25, traced against the CPU RHS):**
     `cufftExecZ2D`/`cufftExecD2Z` return codes are now checked, but both
     `cufftPlan1d` return codes are still discarded. More importantly,
     `set_mode_avg_params` visibly discards `_owin`, `_sidx`, `_pre_re`,
     `_pre_im`, `_beta`, `_nlscale`, and `_sqrt_aeff`, and the GPU RHS has
     no equivalents of CPU Steps 2 and 5–7. Implement those missing
     scaling/normalization/window steps before expanding GPU scope, then
     tighten the test below the config's independently measured nonlinear
     share so a zero-nonlinearity implementation must fail.
1. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-11.** Design doc reconciliation
   (`docs/dev/native-port/GPU.md`). Rewrote §8 (was still the stale
   2026-07-05, pre-hardware "untested" text — the 2026-07-07 verification
   pass and Julia wiring had updated `BACKLOG.md` but never made it back
   into this doc) and §7 (claimed V1 scope was "Kerr (+plasma)"; actual
   shipped scope is Kerr-only — every `set_*_params` beyond
   `set_mode_avg_params`, including `set_plasma_params`, returns `-1`,
   confirmed by reading `cuda_native.rs` directly). §4's `enum{Cpu,Gpu}` vs
   the actual `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` deviation: kept as a documented,
   deliberate divergence (dynamic-dispatch cost is one vtable call per
   accepted step, immaterial next to actual kernel-launch cost; it's also
   what lets `CpuNativeSim`/`CudaNativeSim` share one FFI surface) rather
   than treated as a TODO to "fix" — the doc previously implied this
   should eventually match §4, which it never needs to. No code changed;
   documentation-only.
2. 🟡 **PPT plasma done 2026-07-11 (mode-avg only); broader Raman and radial/modal/
   free-space scope remains open; ADK was then open and completed as the narrow
   2026-07-31 slice.** The single-thread scan description below is
   historical and was superseded by resume item 12 on 2026-07-27. Added to `CudaNativeSim`
   (`cuda_native.rs`/`kernels.cu`/`cuda.rs`): `set_plasma_params` uploads
   the same `SplineSegment` LUT format `PptIonizationRate::rate_vector_gpu`
   already uses (reused directly, no new upload format), then `step()`
   runs a 5-kernel sequence per RK stage — `ppt_ionization_kernel` (reused
   from the standalone `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION` path, parallel over
   `n_time`) → `plasma_fraction_kernel` (fused cumtrapz+ρ-transform,
   single-thread sequential scan) → `plasma_phase_kernel` (parallel) →
   `plasma_current_kernel` (fused cumtrapz+loss-current, single-thread) →
   `plasma_polarization_kernel` (fused cumtrapz+accumulate-into-Pto,
   single-thread) — mirroring `native.rs`'s `apply_plasma_real` exactly.
   Single-thread sequential kernels for the 3 cumtrapz stages, not a
   work-efficient parallel prefix scan (GPU.md's original sketch,
   item 4 below) — a deliberate V1 tradeoff: `n_time` (~2^13-2^16) is
   small enough that one thread looping over it is negligible next to this
   step's FFT/launch cost at mode-averaged scale; would matter more for
   radial's much larger per-column state, not in scope here. `_gpu_native_eligible`
   (`RK45.jl`) relaxed to allow exactly one plain Kerr response plus at
   most one PPT-only plasma response (at that time ADK returned `-1` from
   `set_plasma_params_adk`; it is now thresholded-only GPU support) — the shared FFI call
   (`native_set_plasma_params`) needed zero Julia-side changes beyond the
   eligibility gate, since it already dispatches through the same
   `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` handle both CPU and GPU sims share.
   **Real pre-existing bug found and fixed while wiring this in**:
   `rhs_mode_avg_real_kernel`'s call site passed `(eto_d, pto_d, ...)` but
   the kernel's own declared parameter order is `(pto, eto, ...)` —
   swapped, so the kernel's `pto` write target was actually bound to
   `eto_d` (overwriting the just-FFT'd field with the Kerr result, silently
   discarded before ever being read again) and its `eto` read source was
   bound to `pto_d` (stale/uninitialized memory, not the field) — meaning
   every accepted step's forward FFT (`cufftExecD2Z` on `pto_d`) transformed
   whatever was left in `pto_d` from a previous call, not the real Kerr
   polarisation. Present since the 2026-07-05/07 GPU work, never caught by
   the existing Kerr-only equivalence test because that test's energy is
   weak enough that the resulting error stayed under the test's existing
   ~4.5e-4-driven `<1e-3` tolerance regardless. Fixed by correcting the
   argument order to match the kernel's declaration (also documented
   in-line in `cuda_native.rs`, right at the call site, so it can't silently
   regress again). Every new kernel-arg array is bound through named `let`
   locals, not inline temporaries — the exact UB pattern (`&mut {expr} as
   *mut _`) that caused a real `SIGSEGV` inside `libcuda.so` in the original
   2026-07-07 verification pass; caught in review before this landed.
   **Verified on real CUDA hardware** (RTX 5060 Ti): new
   `test/test_native_cuda.jl` testitem (`"...Kerr+plasma"`) passes,
   `rel_solve ≈ 2.0e-2` at `gas=:Ar, energy=6e-6`. This is *not* the same
   tolerance tier as the Kerr-only sibling test (~1e-3) — diagnosed, not
   assumed: the CPU-resident native path (`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE=1`, no
   CUDA — proper `n_time_over`-sized buffers) matches the Julia oracle for
   this exact config to `1.3e-16`, and sweeping energy 1e-7→6e-6 (60×)
   showed `rel_solve` scaling almost exactly linearly with energy at every
   point — the signature of the same pre-existing, documented
   `n_time`-vs-`n_time_over` Kerr buffer-sizing gap (item 6 below; GPU.md
   §8) amplified roughly 40× by plasma's Keldysh-exponential sensitivity to
   field amplitude, not a new bug. Full 7-group gate green, zero
   regressions (rust 42117/42117 = 42113 baseline + 4 new assertions).
3. 🟢 **Done (2026-07-16).** Problem-size dispatch threshold — measured, not
   guessed, on real hardware (RTX 5060 Ti). Benchmarked `native_step`
   CPU-vs-GPU directly (mode-avg, RealGrid, fixed-step, 10-iteration average
   after warmup) across a size sweep before writing any dispatch code, per
   this backlog's own "benchmark first" discipline (the r2c/c2r item, #3 in
   Phase I above, was investigated the same session and *failed* that same
   gate — no benchmark existed there, so it was correctly left alone).
   **Two very different regimes, not one crossover:**
   - **Kerr-only**: GPU is slower below ~n=8,193 (breakeven ~1.3x there),
     then wins increasingly — 5x at n=16,385, 14x at n=65,537, 27x at
     n=262,145. Dominated by cuFFT throughput at scale; small-n loss is
     CUDA kernel-launch/sync overhead (`cuda_native.rs::step`'s
     `launch_checked` synchronizes after every one of ~dozens of per-stage
     launches).
   - **Kerr+plasma (PPT)**: GPU is 20-30x *slower* than CPU at every size up
     to n=131,073 tested, and the gap *widens* with n — the opposite trend
     from Kerr-only. Root cause: `cuda_native.rs`'s plasma kernels
     (`plasma_fraction_kernel`/`plasma_current_kernel`/
     `plasma_polarization_kernel`) are single-GPU-thread sequential scans
     (item 2's documented V1 tradeoff, item 4/6 below), so they don't
     benefit from n the way cuFFT does — they're pure serial overhead that
     scales with grid size. No crossover exists in the tested range, so a
     single numeric threshold across both regimes would be actively
     misleading.
   - **Fix**: `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=off/on/auto` (`Config.jl`'s new
     `gpu_dispatch::Symbol` field), layered on top of
     `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE`'s existing master opt-in (unchanged).
     `off` forces CPU; `on` restores the old unconditional-GPU behavior
     (kept for forcing GPU on a small/known config, e.g. reproducing a
     specific benchmark); `auto` (**new default**) requires a plasma-free
     RealGrid config at `n >= _GPU_KERR_ONLY_N_THRESHOLD = 16384` and an
     EnvGrid config at the separately measured `_GPU_ENV_KERR_N_THRESHOLD =
     32768` (the first stable substantial EnvGrid win; the 16,384 row had one
     marginal 1.37× batch). The c2c timing curve must not inherit the RealGrid
     r2c/c2r threshold. A plasma-bearing config is rejected by `:auto`
     outright, at any size, since no threshold is supported by data there.
     `RK45._gpu_native_eligible(f!, linop)` split into a pure
     config-shape check (`_gpu_kernel_supports`, unchanged logic) and the
     new size/policy-aware `_gpu_native_eligible(f!, linop, n)` (now 3-arg;
     `n = length(y0)`, threaded through from `RustNativeStepper`'s existing
     `n`). Full measured table and reasoning live in
     `RK45._GPU_KERR_ONLY_N_THRESHOLD`'s docstring, next to the code it
     justifies. Both existing `test_native_cuda.jl` GPU-vs-CPU equivalence
   tests now explicitly set `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` (they test raw kernel
   correctness at deliberately small/known configs, independent of the
   dispatch heuristic — including the Kerr+plasma test, which forces the raw
   GPU path for numerical verification). New
   `test/test_native_gpu_dispatch.jl` covers the
   `:off`/`:on`/`:auto` decision matrix directly (pure Julia-side logic,
   no `ccall`, so it runs without GPU hardware, unlike the sibling
   equivalence tests).
   **2026-07-27 update:** item 12's parallel scans invalidate only the PPT
   half of the original measurement. New GPU/CPU speed is 0.82× at n=2049,
   1.08× at n=4097, and 2.94× at n=8193, so supported PPT configs now use
   their own conservative `_GPU_PPT_N_THRESHOLD=8192`. The Kerr-only
   threshold is unchanged.
4. 🟡 **Mode-averaged SDO Raman is DONE 2026-08-02; broader geometries remain
   open.** Mode-averaged RealGrid, constant-linop, scalar-density,
   plain-Kerr plus at most one **thresholded** ADK `PlasmaCumtrapz` is now
   supported. Its pointwise rate kernel reuses the completed two-level scans;
   independent math/code reviews and strict CUDA integration passed. At
   `n=8193` / `n_time_over=32768`, the retained benchmark is **2.147×**, so
   automatic selection is exactly `_GPU_ADK_N_THRESHOLD=8193` (not 8192).
   `threshold=false` deliberately remains CPU fallback. The completed Raman
   slice supports mode-averaged `RamanPolarField` on RealGrid (`thg=true` and
   `thg=false`) and `RamanPolarEnv` on EnvGrid, reusing the resident
   `native_set_raman_params` contract and CUDA ADE kernel. Its explicit
   capacity is **1–64 flattened SDO oscillators**, covering N₂ rotation (49)
   and rotation+vibration (50); larger responses remain CPU fallback. At the
   time this SDO slice landed, `:SiO2`, mixtures, shot noise, z-dependent
   Raman, and radial/modal/free-space remained excluded; Plan 07 below now
   closes the explicit mode-averaged EnvGrid `:SiO2` slice.
   **Plan 05 follow-up, 2026-08-02:** production-shaped CPU/CUDA sweeps for
   RealGrid THG on/off, EnvGrid, and 50-oscillator rotational Raman reached at
   most 1.141×, below the established 1.4× retention bar. All four named
   Raman `:auto` policy thresholds therefore remain unset; supported Raman is
   CPU-native under `:auto` and CUDA remains explicit via `:on`. The complete
   table and the bounded large-rotational benchmark gotcha are in
   `luna-feature-plans/LUNA_FEATURE_PLAN_05_GPU_RAMAN_AUTO_POLICY.md`.
   The former radial-Raman gap described here was closed by Plan 12's
   segmented/batched column launch; this historical note explains why the
   one-dimensional mode-averaged launcher could not simply be reused.
5. 🟢 **Raman CUDA coverage landed 2026-08-02** in
   `test/test_native_cuda_raman.jl`: direct stage/non-vacuity checks, fixed
   and rejected-step trajectories, EnvGrid, and `:SiO2` CPU fallback for the
   pre-Plan-07 path.
   **Review follow-up, 2026-08-02:** `_gpu_kernel_supports` had independently
   accepted EnvGrid and plasma even though `compute_rhs_mode_avg_env` applies
   only Kerr and Raman. A low-level `TransModeAvg` could therefore select CUDA
   and silently lose its plasma term. The predicate now requires RealGrid for
   every plasma response; a no-hardware dispatch regression constructs the
   low-level EnvGrid+ADK shape and compares its forced-`on` CPU fallback with
   explicit CPU native at the single-step reassociation tier. Documentation
   now states that CUDA plasma is RealGrid-only.
   **Rotational-capacity follow-up:** the resident CUDA ADE now shares a
   generated 64-oscillator limit between Rust and PTX; Julia rejects 65 before
   CUDA setup. N₂ rotation and rotation+vibration are verified at 49/50
   oscillators, with no kernel truncation.
   **Plan 07 follow-up, 2026-08-02:** mode-averaged EnvGrid
   `RamanRespIntermediateBroadening`/`:SiO2` now uses the existing
   `native_set_raman_fft_params` contract and resident r2c/c2r convolution;
   no host field transfer occurs inside an RHS evaluation. Transactional
   allocation/copy/plan failures preserve the active setup. The strict CUDA
   bucket passed **157/157**, with direct stage error `5.74e-16` and a
   six-step fixed trajectory error `1.46e-16`; `:auto` remains CPU-selected.
6. 🟢 **The `n_time`-vs-`n_time_over` Kerr/plasma buffer-sizing fidelity gap
   is closed (2026-07-25).** Item 0's nonlinear-pipeline repair resized the
   buffers/plans and added the required crop/pad path; the older item-2 text is
   historical and does not reopen it.
7. 🟢 **Plan 08 — radial RealGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-02.** The CUDA
   backend now stages `TransRadial` + RealGrid + scalar-density + constant
   linop/norm + one plain Kerr through the existing
   `native_set_radial_params` FFI symbol. Julia's QDHT matrix, normalization,
   and time window are resident; the CUDA RHS performs spectrum expansion,
   per-column D2Z/Z2D cuFFT, QDHT matrix products, Kerr/windowing, and final
   crop/normalization without host field transfers. Setup is transactional and
   validates shapes, finite values, allocation sizes, integer ranges, and plan
   return codes. Explicit `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` is supported; radial `:auto`
   remains disabled, and plasma/Raman/noise/mixtures/z-dependence plus other
   geometries remain CPU fallback. The focused CUDA item passed 25/25 on the
   RTX 5060 Ti, with fixed-solve relative error `4.772174254620178e-16`, a
   nonsymmetric QDHT probe, rollback, and adaptive reject/retry. The temporal
   pad scale is kept separate from QDHT `scaleRK`; this distinction fixed the
   stage-scale defect found during hardware verification. See Plan 08 and the
   latest `PORT_LOG.md` entry.
8. 🟢 **Plan 09 — radial EnvGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-02.** The CUDA
   backend now admits the complementary `TransRadial` + EnvGrid + scalar-Kerr
   slice under the same explicit `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` policy. It stages
   complex time/spectrum/QDHT buffers and a resident c2c plan transactionally;
   the RHS mirrors `CpuNativeSim::rhs_radial_env`'s low/high spectrum
   placement, inverse/forward c2c normalization, complex QDHT directions,
   `3/4` envelope Kerr, window, crop, and normalization. The CUDA test covers
   an asymmetric complex stage, nonsymmetric QDHT, invalid replacement
   rollback, fixed solve, and adaptive rejection/retry. Radial `:auto` remains
   disabled, and plasma/Raman/noise/mixtures/z-dependence remain CPU fallback.
   See Plan 09, `GPU.md`, and the latest `PORT_LOG.md` entry.
9. 🟢 **Plan 10 — radial RealGrid PPT plasma — DONE 2026-08-02.** The CUDA
   backend now extends the radial RealGrid Kerr slice with one resident PPT
   `PlasmaCumtrapz`. Rate, fraction, current, and polarization use independent
   256-thread segmented scans for each radial column, including multi-block
   and partial-final columns; the PPT kernels read the post-QDHT field and
   accumulate plasma polarization before the radial time window. Setup is
   transactional, explicit `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` only, and the eligibility
   gate remains limited to scalar density, constant linop/norm, one Kerr, and
   one PPT response. The strict focused CUDA test passed 27/27 on the RTX 5060
   Ti, with direct-stage error `1.5647312256418479e-15` and fixed-solve error
   `4.756600300395168e-16`; radial EnvGrid plasma, ADK, unsupported Raman
   combinations, noise, and automatic dispatch remain deferred. See Plan 10, `GPU.md`, and the latest
   `PORT_LOG.md` entry.
10. 🟢 **Plan 11 — radial RealGrid thresholded ADK — DONE 2026-08-02.** The
   radial RealGrid CUDA slice now accepts one thresholded `IonRateADK` beside
   scalar Kerr and reuses the Plan 10 per-column segmented fraction/current/
   polarization scans. The post-QDHT field, exact threshold/non-finite kernel
   contract, transactional ADK setup, and explicit-on-only dispatch were
   verified on the RTX 5060 Ti: the focused strict CUDA item passed 43/43,
   with direct-stage error `1.4991322388752626e-15`, fixed-solve error
   `1.712696193041123e-16`, and native-vs-Julia strong-field error
   `3.253050910467547e-16`. Unthresholded ADK, EnvGrid plasma, and radial
   automatic dispatch remain CPU-selected. See Plan 11, `GPU.md`, and the
   latest `PORT_LOG.md` entry.
11. 🟢 **Plan 12 — radial RealGrid SDO Raman — DONE 2026-08-04.**
   `CudaNativeSim` now sizes Raman intensity/polarization/Hilbert scratch as
   `n_time_over*n_r`, launches one independent resident ADE series per radial
   column, and uses a batched c2c Hilbert plan with a column-local analytic
   signal mask for `thg=false`. Julia eligibility admits only one scalar-density
   RealGrid `RamanPolarField` made from 1–64 flattened SDO oscillators; plasma,
   EnvGrid Raman, mixtures, noise, and radial `:auto` remain CPU-selected.
   The focused item is `test/test_native_cuda_radial_raman.jl`; CPU radial
   Raman remains covered by `test/test_native_radial_raman.jl`. Hardware
   Hardware verification passed on the RTX 5060 Ti: the focused strict CUDA
   item passed 30/30, with direct-stage errors `1.21e-15`–`1.23e-15` and
   fixed-solve errors `2.42e-16` and `2.60e-16`. See Plan 12, `GPU.md`, and
   the latest `PORT_LOG.md` entry.
12. 🟢 **Plan 13 — radial EnvGrid SDO Raman — DONE 2026-08-04.** `CudaNativeSim` now reuses the Plan 09 complex
   radial buffers and Plan 12's per-column ADE launch for one scalar-density
   `RamanPolarEnv`: direct `0.5*abs2(E)` intensity, one series per radial
   column, and complex `density*E*P` accumulation before the shared window and
   QDHT/c2c tail. Julia eligibility admits only matching EnvGrid SDO Raman
   (1–64 flattened oscillators), keeps radial `:auto` false, and rejects
   plasma, intermediate broadening, mixtures, and noise. CPU radial EnvGrid
   Raman passes its focused equivalence/non-vacuity suite. Strict hardware
   verification passed the focused Plan 13 CUDA item and the complete strict
   Rust group; see Plan 13, `GPU.md`, and the focused
   `test_native_cuda_radial_env_raman.jl` item.
13. 🟢 **Plan 14 — modal RealGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-04.** The CUDA
   backend now evaluates constant-radius Marcatili/Zeisberger/Vincetti modal
   fields through resident synthesis, batched cuFFT, scalar/vector Kerr,
   windowing, and modal projection, while host libcubature retains adaptive
   node placement. Both `full=false`/`true` and `npol=1`/`2` are covered, with
   explicit-on eligibility and modal `:auto` disabled. The strict focused item
   passed 37/37 on the RTX 5060 Ti: fixed-node and direct-stage errors were
   `1.11e-15`–`1.41e-15`, the two-mode fixed-solve error was `4.07e-16`, and
   the rejected adaptive trial preserved state. HE11→HE12 transfer was
   `8.49e-6`; the Kerr on/off control was `2.53e-2`. See Plan 14, `GPU.md`,
   and `test/test_native_cuda_modal.jl`.
14. 🟢 **Plan 15 — modal EnvGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-08.** The modal
   CUDA point evaluator now uses resident batched c2c transforms and complex
   envelope scratch for EnvGrid, with the exact low/high spectrum expansion
   and crop plus scalar/vector `Kerr_env` formulas. Both cubature branches and
   `npol=1|2` passed strict hardware verification: fixed-node errors were
   `4.82e-16`–`6.12e-16`, direct-stage errors `3.07e-16`–`3.27e-16`, and the
   fixed-solve error `5.97e-16`; HE11→HE12 transfer was `8.41e-6` and the
   Julia Kerr-on/off control was `0.0252`. Rejection/retry and adaptive
   agreement passed, the strict focused Plan 14+15 run was 72/72, and the
   complete strict Rust group was 43,227/43,227. Modal `:auto`, Raman, plasma,
   noise, mixtures, tapered radius, and free-space remain excluded. See Plan
   15, `GPU.md`, and `test/test_native_cuda_modal_env.jl`.
15. 🟢 **Plan 16 — modal RealGrid scalar SDO Raman — DONE 2026-08-08.** The
   modal CUDA callback now owns one Raman intensity/ADE/Hilbert series per
   node in the fixed batch of 32, supports both direct THG `E²` and the
   batched analytic-signal Hilbert branch, and accumulates Raman before the
   existing window/projection pipeline. Eligibility admits only scalar
   RealGrid `npol=1` Kerr plus one flattenable SDO `RamanPolarField` (1–64
   oscillators); EnvGrid Raman, `npol=2`, plasma, noise, mixtures,
   intermediate broadening, and modal `:auto` remain excluded. Strict CUDA
   Plan 16 passed 28/28 with vibrational and 49-oscillator rotational direct
   stages at ~1.3e-15, fixed-solve error `4.6e-16`, adaptive error `1.3e-16`,
   and Julia Raman-on/off effect `7.1e-4`. See Plan 16, `GPU.md`, and
   `test/test_native_cuda_modal_raman.jl`.
16. 🟢 **Plan 17 — free-space RealGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-08.** The
   CUDA backend now stages a transactional free-space setup with separate
   real/complex `(t,y,x)` scratch, Julia's transferred free-space
   normalization, and independent 3-D cuFFT D2Z/Z2D plans. The dimensions are
   passed as `(n_x,n_y,n_time)` so the halved cuFFT dimension is time while
   preserving Julia's column-major layout; the resident RHS performs one joint
   inverse transform, explicit `1/(n_time*n_y*n_x)` scaling, Kerr/windowing,
   and one joint forward transform before crop/normalization. Eligibility is
   explicit-only and limited to constant-linop/constant-norm RealGrid scalar
   Kerr; EnvGrid, z-dependent norm/linop, plasma/Raman/noise, and `:auto`
   remain excluded. Strict hardware verification passed 28/28 on a non-square
   `8×6` grid, including nonsymmetric spectral data, non-vacuity, fixed and
   adaptive trajectories, rejection, invalid dimensions, and transactional
   setup. See Plan 17, `GPU.md`, and `test/test_native_cuda_free.jl`.
17. 🟢 **Plan 18 — free-space EnvGrid scalar Kerr — DONE 2026-08-08.** The
   CUDA free-space setup now stages full-spectrum complex scratch and a joint
   3-D Z2Z cuFFT plan for EnvGrid, preserving both low/high temporal halves,
   applying explicit `1/(n_time_over*n_y*n_x)` inverse scaling, scalar
   `Kerr_env`, windowing, crop, and Julia's transferred normalization. The
   non-square `8×6` strict CUDA test passed 28/28, including asymmetric
   complex stage data, fixed/adaptive trajectories, rejected-step preservation,
   and valid-then-invalid transactional c2c setup. Eligibility remains
   explicit-only; free-space plasma/Raman/noise, z-dependent norm/linop, and
   `:auto` remain CPU-selected. See Plan 18, `GPU.md`, and
   `test/test_native_cuda_free_env.jl`.
18. 🟢 **Plan 19 — free-space RealGrid PPT plasma — DONE 2026-08-08.** The
   CUDA free-space RealGrid path now stages PPT rate/fraction/current/
   polarization scratch for every `(y,x)` series and uses a segmented
   multi-block prefix scan with series-local offsets before the joint 3-D
   forward transform. Eligibility admits only constant-linop/constant-norm
   scalar Kerr plus one PPT response; EnvGrid plasma, ADK, Raman, noise,
   z-dependent norm/linop, and `:auto` remain CPU-selected. Strict hardware
   verification passed 28/28 on a non-square `10×8` grid: stage `1.3e-15`,
   fixed solve `5.0e-16`, adaptive `1.3e-14`, and Julia plasma effect
   `1.57e-6`. See Plan 19, `GPU.md`, and
   `test/test_native_cuda_free_ppt.jl`.
19. 🟢 **Plan 20 — free-space RealGrid thresholded ADK — DONE 2026-08-08.**
   The CUDA free-space RealGrid path now reuses Plan 19's independent
   per-`(y,x)` segmented scans with the exact thresholded ADK rate, including
   non-finite and below-threshold zero semantics. Eligibility admits one
   thresholded ADK response alongside scalar Kerr; unthresholded ADK,
   EnvGrid plasma, Raman/noise, z-dependent norm/linop, and `:auto` remain
   CPU-selected. Strict CUDA verification passed 43/43 on a non-square
   `10×8` grid: stage errors `1.2e-15`/`1.3e-15`, fixed solve `4.8e-16`,
   adaptive solve `1.4e-16`, and Julia ADK effect `2.7e-3`. See Plan 20,
   `GPU.md`, and `test/test_native_cuda_free_adk.jl`.
20. 🟢 **Plan 21 — free-space RealGrid SDO Raman — DONE 2026-08-09.** The
   CUDA free-space RealGrid path now sizes resident Raman intensity,
   polarization, and Hilbert scratch for one independent series per flattened
   `(y,x)` point and applies the SDO ADE before windowing and the joint 3-D
   transform. Eligibility admits one scalar `RamanPolarField` beside Kerr,
   with 1–64 flattenable SDO/rotational oscillators, both THG modes, and
   rejects EnvGrid Raman, plasma+Raman, noise, mixtures, z-dependent
   normalization, and `:auto`. Strict hardware verification passed 44/44 on
   a non-square `10×8` grid: direct stage errors `1.28e-15`–`1.35e-15`,
   fixed-solve errors `2.62e-16`/`2.68e-16`, and Julia Raman effects
   `1.18e-3`. See Plan 21, `GPU.md`, and
   `test/test_native_cuda_free_raman.jl`.

### 🟢 S5 — Numerics options (suggestions 10, 11, 12) — COMPLETE (all 3 items, closed 2026-07-23)
*Item 2 done 2026-07-11 (re-scoped). Items 1 and 3 investigated 2026-07-19
— both re-scoped after measurement (item 1: bar not cleared, reverted;
item 3: backlog premise wrong, the DP5 5th-order continuous extension is
not the coefficient swap the entry implied — deferred as a larger item).
Item 3 then landed 2026-07-23, together with a fix for the FSAL/k1 bug that
had been holding *every* stepper's dense output at first order; see the
"Open remainders" list above and `native-port/portlog-inbox/dense-order5.md`.*
1. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-19 — measured, bar not cleared, reverted (S1.6
   discipline).** Mixed-precision spike (item 10). Added a timeboxed
   Criterion bench (`amalthea/benches/mixed_precision_bench.rs`, since
   reverted) microbenchmarking the precision-sensitive inner arithmetic of
   one accepted Dormand-Prince step — the two 7-term stage combinations
   (`yn = field + dt·Σ b5ᵢ·kᵢ`, `yerr = dt·Σ errᵢ·kᵢ`) plus the weak error
   norm (`native.rs`'s `native_step`, lines ~4272-4363) — in f64 vs. an
   f32-mixed variant (stages held/combined in f32, norm reduced in f64:
   the most generous case for the error estimate).
   - **Measured speedup (`target-cpu=native`, this 12-core host): ~1.0-1.06×**
     — f64 vs f32-mixed at n=8192: 65.8µs vs 64.8µs (1.02×); n=16384:
     132.9µs vs 131.4µs (1.01×); n=65536: 577µs vs 546µs (1.06×). Far
     below the >1.4× gate (a). The loop is compute/FMA-bound and already
     well auto-vectorised in f64, not the memory-bandwidth-bound loop that
     would have let f32's halved byte-count translate to speed — so f32
     buys almost nothing here.
   - Gate (b) would also fail regardless of (a): the error estimate is the
     b5−b4 near-total cancellation (TESTING.md §3 / CLAUDE.md's Phase-2
     gotcha — a ~1e-15 summation-order difference already amplifies into a
     ~20% relative `err` swing near the FP-noise floor, which the PI
     controller turns into a different step path). f32's ~1e-7 relative
     precision on the cancelling `Σ errᵢ·kᵢ` sum cannot keep the adaptive
     step sequence identical, so even a hypothetical speed win would change
     the propagation.
   - **Decision: do not implement; bench reverted** (only the numbers above
     retained, per the S1.6 add/measure/revert precedent).
2. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-11 — re-scoped, backlog's own premise was partly
   wrong.** Deterministic mode (item 11). Investigated before writing any
   code (per the S1.4/S4 pattern of checking the backlog's premise against
   current architecture, not just its literal wording):
   - **"Pinning `dispatch.rs` to the portable lane" — dropped.**
     `dispatch.rs`'s `SimulationEngine`/`HardwarePath` is a vestigial
     hardware-path *selector*, never wired into any RHS kernel's actual
     codegen (same finding class as S1.4: real vectorization comes from
     `target-cpu=native` at compile time, not a runtime branch this enum
     could gate). There is nothing to "pin."
   - **"Forcing sequential reductions" — the default native path already
     *is* run-to-run deterministic on one machine.** With S2 Phase 3
     reverted, no RHS code reads `n_threads` yet. Every parallel seam that
     exists today (the QDHT Rayon fallback, the older per-kernel
     `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT` batch loops in `ffi.rs`) is embarrassingly
     parallel — each output row/column computed independently with no
     cross-thread reduction — and native FFTW plans only ever use
     `FFTW_ESTIMATE` (no wisdom-dependent plan selection by default, see
     S1 item 1). So a naive "two runs bit-identical" test would pass
     whether or not a new toggle did anything — and a first implementation
     attempt shipped exactly that vacuous test before catching it.
   - **The one real, addressable lever: process-global BLAS-eligibility.**
     `amalthea/src/blas.rs`'s `BLAS_API` is an `OnceLock`, populated only
     by the older per-kernel `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT`+`AMALTHEA_QDHT_BLAS` path
     (`NonlinearRHS._init_rust_qdht_blas`). Once populated, it silently
     makes *every later* native-path radial-QDHT call in that process
     BLAS-eligible too, even though nothing in the native construction
     path asked for it — a process-global-state contamination hazard in
     the same family as S1 item 1's wisdom-pool finding. BLAS-3 `dgemm`
     (OpenBLAS/MKL) and the row-parallel Rayon fallback sum in a different
     order, so which one silently gets taken is a real,
     configuration-order-dependent effect on the result.
   - **Fix:** `native_set_deterministic(handle, bool)` FFI (`native.rs`,
     `NativeBackend` trait + `CpuNativeSim`/`CudaNativeSim` impls) forces
     the native-port radial `QdhtFfiHandle` to skip the BLAS branch
     regardless of `BLAS_API` state; a second FFI,
     `qdht_ffi_set_deterministic` (`ffi.rs`), does the same for the
     per-kernel handle — needed because that's the only call site that
     ever populates `BLAS_API` in the first place, so leaving it unwired
     would make the flag inert exactly where contamination originates.
     `deterministic::Bool` added to `Config.jl`'s `BackendConfig`
     (`AMALTHEA_NATIVE_DETERMINISTIC`, default off), read at both call sites
     (`RK45.jl`'s native construction, `NonlinearRHS._make_rust_qdht_handle`).
     **What this guarantees: BLAS-eligibility invariance** — the result no
     longer depends on whether some unrelated earlier construction in the
     same process touched `AMALTHEA_QDHT_BLAS`, nor on which BLAS
     implementation/thread-count Julia happens to have linked. **What it
     does NOT guarantee:** bit-identical results across different
     machines/CPU targets (`target-cpu=native` means a different build
     host takes a different SIMD/libm path); it is also not "fixing" a
     same-process run-to-run instability that was never observed to exist
     at these problem sizes.
   - **Test:** `test/test_native_deterministic.jl`, tagged `:rust`.
     Deliberately does *not* stop at "two runs bit-identical" (that alone
     can't distinguish a working flag from an inert one, as above) —
     T1 establishes the two-runs-bit-identical baseline before `BLAS_API`
     is ever touched; the test then explicitly contaminates process-global
     `BLAS_API` via `NonlinearRHS._make_rust_qdht_handle` (mirroring a real
     session that mixes the per-kernel and native-port Rust paths); T2
     asserts `deterministic=false` vs. `deterministic=true` now produce
     numerically *different* results (`s_blas.yn != s_det.yn`) — proof the
     flag actually gates the BLAS branch rather than being unreachable;
     T3 re-confirms bit-identical repeats under `deterministic=true` even
     after contamination; T4 confirms toggling back off doesn't crash and
     still produces a finite result. Gate: full 7-group suite —
     rust 42111/42111 (42101 baseline + this item's 10 new assertions,
     zero drift elsewhere), physics/sim-interface/sim-multimode/
     sim-propagation/io/fields all green (see ARCHIVE.md's "Done (recent)" for the
     dated full run).
3. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-23 — genuine order-5 continuous extension plus the
   FSAL/k1 correctness fix.** The landed implementation uses the
   Calvo–Montijano–Rández extra-stage tableau on both Julia and resident
   native steppers; see the open-remainders summary above and
   `native-port/portlog-inbox/dense-order5.md`.

   **Historical 2026-07-19 investigation (superseded by the implementation
   above):**
   The entry read: "Shampine's DP5 continuous extension in
   `native.rs::interpolate` and `RK45.jl`'s `interpC`, same commit — removes
   the Julia-vs-native saved-grid tolerance tier entirely." Two structural
   facts (config-independent, not just measured) make this incorrect:
   - **There is no `native.rs::interpolate`.** Dense output for the native
     stepper is reconstructed *in Julia* (`interpolate(s::RustNativeStepper,
     ti)`, `RK45.jl:2053`): it fetches the 7 resident RK stages via the
     `get_ks_stage` FFI and applies the *same* `interpC` quartic as
     `PreconStepper` (which reads them from `s.ks`), then re-expresses the
     polynomial at the query time via `native_apply_prop`. Rust exposes the
     stages and the propagator; the interpolation math is Julia-side for
     *both* steppers.
   - **Changing interpolant order therefore cannot change native-vs-Julia
     agreement.** Both sides evaluate the identical interpolant from the
     identical stages, so their saved-grid difference is the Phase-1
     native-vs-Julia *method* tolerance (FFT/summation-order + Rust-`exp`
     vs Julia-`exp` in the propagator), not an interpolation-order effect.
     Measured (Kerr-only default config, `test_native_phase8.jl`): dense
     output (saveN=50) native-vs-Julia rel = **2.2e-11**, essentially the
     same order as the saveN=2 endpoints, **1.1e-11** — no interpolation-
     driven tier exists to "remove." (The old test threshold was `1e-8`,
     ~3 orders looser than reality; tightened to `1e-9` this pass — the one
     shippable piece of the item. Aside: the endpoint comment claims
     "~1e-13"; the real figure is ~1e-11, 2 orders looser than documented —
     unrelated doc drift, left as-is.)
   - **A genuine 5th-order continuous extension is real but different work.**
     DP5's 7-stage FSAL "free" interpolant is provably *order 4* (Hairer &
     Wanner II.6; it's the same MATLAB `ntrp45`/scipy interpolant), so
     reaching order 5 requires *extra function evaluation(s)* per
     interpolated step (Shampine 1986), i.e. a lazy extra-stage machinery on
     both the resident Rust stepper (a new FFI to evaluate + return the
     extra stage) and Julia. Its benefit is better accuracy of dense output
     **against the true solution** — which no current test measures (the
     whole suite's only native dense-output check is the native-vs-Julia one
     above; there is no dense-vs-analytic tier where 4th-order interpolation
     error is the limiter). So it neither shrinks the native-vs-Julia tier
     nor tightens any existing test; it's a standalone accuracy improvement,
     deferred until someone wants it. **Future implementer:** add an extra
     stage to `native.rs` exposed via a new `get_extra_stage`-style FFI,
     port the order-5 continuous-extension coefficients into a shared Julia
     helper used by both `interpolate` methods, and add a *new*
     dense-vs-fine-reference test (not a native-vs-Julia one) to show the
     order gain.

### ⚪ S6 — Distribution & ecosystem (suggestions 9, 13, 14)
*Items 1-2 are implemented. Item 3 was measured and parked; the live S6 work
is the v1.0.0 asset-name repair/validation and the example repairs in the
resume queue.*
1. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-11.** Prebuilt binaries (item 13).
   `.github/workflows/release.yml`: triggered on `v*` tags (same tags
   TagBot.yml pushes after a Julia registry release) or manual dispatch;
   builds `libamalthea` on the same three CI hosts `run_tests.yml` already
   tests on (`ubuntu-latest`→`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `macos-latest`→
   `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `windows-2025-vs2026`→`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`),
   deliberately with `RUSTFLAGS=""` (portable, no `target-cpu=native` —
   unlike the dev/test build path — since a downloaded binary must run on
   any user's CPU, not just the builder's); stages each asset as
   `libamalthea-<triple>.<ext>` with a per-asset `.sha256` file, then a
   `publish` job merges all `.sha256` files into one `SHA256SUMS.txt` and
   uploads everything to a GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release`.
   `deps/build.jl` gained `try_download_prebuilt(rust_dir)`, tried before
   the existing `cargo build --release` fallback: resolves the release
   asset from `Project.toml`'s version + the running platform's target
   triple (only the 3 triples above; anything else — e.g. linux non-x86_64
   — returns `nothing` and falls straight to source), downloads the binary
   + `SHA256SUMS.txt`, verifies the asset's sha256 against the manifest
   entry, and only then moves it into the exact
   `amalthea/target/release/<libname>` path every `_libamalthea_path*()`
   helper across `src/*.jl` already resolves to — so no Artifacts.toml or
   separate lookup path was needed, just placing the file where the
   existing from-source build already puts it. Any failure at any step
   (network, unsupported platform, missing release, checksum mismatch) is
   caught, logged via `@info`, and falls back to `cargo build --release`
   silently — never `rethrow`s from the download path itself. Opt-out:
   `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` forces straight to source (useful for local
   dev iteration on `amalthea/`, where a stale downloaded binary would
   silently shadow local changes). **Verified:** the fallback path returns
   `false` cleanly, leaves any existing library file untouched (mtime
   unchanged), and leaves no `.download`/`SHA256SUMS.txt` temp files behind.
   The download+verify+install happy path was verified in isolation
   against a local HTTP server serving a real build of `libamalthea.so`
   plus its real sha256 manifest line — confirmed the checksum-match branch
   installs correctly. **Live release defect, verified 2026-07-25 with
   `gh release view v1.0.0`:** the tag exists, but its assets use legacy
   `libluna_rust-*` names while current `deps/build.jl` requests
   `libamalthea-*`; the real download therefore misses and falls back to
   Cargo. Resume-queue item 4 owns the compatibility fix and end-to-end
   clean-install validation.
2. 🟢 **Done 2026-07-19 (commit 05c4a4e).** Rust-side scan HDF5 writer
   (item 9) — `io.rs` `scan_write_point(...)` (+ `create_dataset_nd_julia`)
   writes a finished scan point's field/z arrays directly from native buffers,
   matching HDF5.jl's column-major dim-reversal so Julia reads them back
   untransposed; optional scan-queue `FlockLock`/`LockFileEx` coordination.
   Exposed via `scan_write_point_ffi` + the opt-in
   `Output.write_scan_point_native` (default Julia `HDF5Output` path
   unchanged). Also fixed a latent `io::H5T_COMPOUND` constant bug (was 3 =
   H5T_STRING). Test: `test/test_scan_native_write.jl` (:rust).
3. 🔴 **Measured, then parked — recommend against building as specified.**
   Standalone CLI (item 14). See
   `docs/dev/native-port/PLANS.md §4` for the full feasibility writeup.
   Finding: a Julia-free CLI needs the *entire* `prop_capillary` setup path
   (grid construction, mode dispersion, pulse synthesis, gas properties)
   reimplemented in Rust with nothing left to fall back on — exactly the
   one-time setup code `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6a already classified as
   "stays Julia by design, porting it buys nothing" for the per-step-loop
   goal, being asked for again for a different reason. Two pieces are
   genuine new dependencies, not mechanical ports: `PhysData.density`
   (needed for the Kerr coefficient) calls the external CoolProp real-gas
   library, and mode-averaged `Aeff` needs a Bessel-J evaluator + Bessel-
   zero root-finder (cubature.rs already supplies the quadrature
   primitive, so this one is smaller than first assessed, but still new
   special-function surface). The comparison-against-Julia acceptance
   test also would not be bit-parity — it inherits every setup-path
   numerical divergence, the same situation as Phase 7's β1
   analytic-vs-FD gap. TOML/cargo-feature gating itself is *not* a
   blocker (confirmed: `optional = true` deps + `required-features` on
   the `[[bin]]` leaves plain `cargo build --release` unaffected).
   Recommended alternative if this is ever picked up: a much smaller
   "dump-and-replay" CLI — Julia serializes the exact arrays it already
   passes to `native_set_mode_avg_params`/etc. once, and `luna-cli`
   replays them through the unmodified native stepper — which needs no
   new setup-porting work and gives a genuine bit-identical acceptance
   test, at the cost of not being Julia-free from a cold start. WASM
   (the item's stated follow-on) is blocked separately regardless: FFTW
   and HDF5 are both `dlopen`ed native libraries with no general `dlopen`
   equivalent in WASM.

**Current execution order:** use the dated resume queue at the top of this
file. The older track-order plan has been completed or superseded.

### 🟢 Native-Rust backend port (phased)

**Goal:** make the propagation backend run **exclusively in Rust** — no Julia
callback in the per-step hot loop. **Finding:** even with all five
`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_*` toggles ON, ~80% of per-step cost is still Julia. The Rust
stepper (`precon_step_ffi`) drives the loop but calls Julia `fbar!`/`prop!` back
through C function pointers on **every** RK stage, so every FFT (there is no Rust
FFT), Kerr, plasma `cumtrapz`, window/norm broadcasts, and the `exp(linop)`
application stay in Julia. "Exclusively Rust" therefore requires a **resident
`NativeSim`** field + native RHS + FFTW binding, not a default-flip.

Design docs (read before starting any phase):
[`docs/dev/native-port/ARCHITECTURE.md`](native-port/ARCHITECTURE.md) ·
[`docs/dev/native-port/MATH.md`](native-port/MATH.md) ·
[`docs/dev/native-port/TESTING.md`](native-port/TESTING.md) ·
[`docs/dev/native-port/PORT_LOG.md`](native-port/PORT_LOG.md) ·
agent workflow `AGENTS.md`. New toggle: `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE`.

Phases (each independently shippable; gate = single-step ~1e-13 **and**
full-`solve` ~1e-6 vs the Julia oracle — see TESTING.md §3 nondeterminism floor):

- ✅ **Phase 0 — Foundations.** `NativeSim` opaque handle; FFTW binding;
  `init_native_sim` / `free_native_sim` / `set_field` / `get_field`; callback-free
  `native_step` (`RustNativeStepper` in `src/RK45.jl`). Replaces callback round-trip
  in `amalthea/src/ffi.rs:1002` + `src/RK45.jl:309-319`. Gate passed: set/get
  bit-exact; no-op RHS rel_solve < 1e-6 (zero-RHS → bit-exact). 41928/41928 rust
  group pass. Test `test/test_native_phase0.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 1 — Mode-averaged + Kerr (RealGrid).** `rhs_mode_avg_real` +
  `native_set_mode_avg_params`; ports `to_time!`/`to_freq!`, Kerr, windows,
  `norm_mode_average`, exp-linop prop. Replaces `TransModeAvg`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:531`) + Kerr (`src/Nonlinear.jl:81`). First fully-Rust
  `prop_capillary(:HE11, Kerr)`. Gate passed: single-step ≤1e-13, full-solve
  5.8e-13. Test `test/test_native_phase1.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 2 — Plasma + EnvGrid Kerr.** `rhs_mode_avg_env` (EnvGrid c2c Kerr,
  3/4 SVEA factor) + `native_set_plasma_params`/plasma current assembly (rate
  LUT already Rust). Replaces `PlasmaCumtrapz` (`src/Nonlinear.jl:161`) +
  EnvGrid Kerr. Gate passed: Phase 2a (EnvGrid Kerr) single-step <1e-13,
  full-solve 3.2e-17; Phase 2b (RealGrid+plasma) single-step 3.8e-17,
  full-solve 2.7e-16 — all with fixed step size (see PORT_LOG 2026-07-01: the
  adaptive PI controller's near-cancellation error estimate is FP-noise
  sensitive and not itself a meaningful equivalence signal). Also fixed a
  latent `RustNativeStepper.s.y`-not-updated bug that broke `interpolate()`.
  Test `test/test_native_phase2.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 3 — Radial (TransRadial) + resident QDHT.** `rhs_radial` reuses the
  existing `QdhtFfiHandle` directly (no FFI round-trip per RHS) + a
  precomputed complex `(n_ω, n_r)` normalization array (folds `norm_radial` +
  `ωwin`, valid for a z-invariant `normfun`). Replaces `TransRadial`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:663`). Scope: RealGrid + scalar Kerr only (EnvGrid and
  plasma-radial deferred). Gate passed: single-step 1.1e-17, full-solve
  1.3e-16 (fixed step size, per the Phase 2 lesson — see PORT_LOG
  2026-07-01). Test `test/test_native_radial.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 4 — Raman.** `rhs_mode_avg_real` gains an additive Raman term via
  the resident `TimeDomainRamanSolver` (already-existing ADE solver, reused
  directly) + `native_set_raman_params`. Replaces `RamanPolarField`
  (`src/Nonlinear.jl:357`). Scope: RealGrid, `thg=true` only, all-SDO
  density-independent-τ2 eligibility (same criteria as `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`).
  Gate passed: full-solve Rust-vs-Julia 4.2e-8 — independently verified
  non-vacuous (Raman changes the Julia oracle's full-solve result by 1.1e-4,
  self-validated in-test; a single 1cm z-step alone shows Raman's
  contribution below the FP floor relative to Kerr — the effect is
  cumulative over propagation, see PORT_LOG 2026-07-01). Test
  `test/test_native_raman.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 5 — Modal (TransModal), narrow scope.** Binds the *same*
  `libcubature` C library Julia's `Cubature.jl` wraps (`Cubature_jll`,
  dlopened at runtime like FFTW — not a reimplemented cubature algorithm, so
  adaptive node placement is bit-identical, not just close). Per-node
  evaluation reuses the existing rank-1 FFT plans + Kerr formula. Scope:
  RealGrid, constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` with `kind=:HE, n=1` only (needs
  only `besselj(0,·)`/`besselj(1,·)`, already in `diffraction.rs`),
  `full=false` (the radial modal integral — what `Interface.needfull`
  already selects for `HE,n=1` mode collections, not an artificial
  restriction), Kerr-only, `shotnoise=false`. Replaces `TransModal`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:421`, `pointcalc!` `:363`, `Erω_to_Prω!` `:401`) within
  that scope. Keeps the integration loop **sequential** (prior
  `Threads.@threads` race). Gate passed: two-mode (HE11+HE12) single-step
  1.4e-19, full-solve 4.0e-16 (fixed step size) — independently verified
  non-vacuous (HE11→HE12 energy transfer is 2.0e-5 of total energy, far above
  any noise floor). General-order modes (`TE`/`TM`/`n>1`), tapered radius,
  `full=true`, EnvGrid, and Raman/plasma-in-modal are deferred (see MATH.md
  §3.3). Test `test/test_native_modal.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 6 — Free-space (TransFree).** A genuine 3-D FFTW plan
  (`fftw.rs::RealFft3d`, new `fftw_plan_dft_r2c_3d`/`_c2r_3d` symbols — same
  libfftw3 binary Julia's `FFTW.jl` uses, not a new library) replaces the
  QDHT-plus-1-D pattern Phase 3 used for radial. Dimension order
  (`(n_x,n_y,n_t)` reversed for Julia's column-major `(n_t,n_y,n_x)`) and the
  `1/(n_t·n_y·n_x)` round-trip normalization were verified against a literal
  `FFTW.rfft` reference before being trusted, not assumed from the
  row/column-major rule alone. Scope: RealGrid, `const_norm_free`
  (z-invariant), scalar Kerr, `shotnoise=false`. Replaces `TransFree`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:826`) within that scope. Gate passed: single-step
  7.05e-18, full-solve 5.01e-17 (fixed step size). EnvGrid (c2c 3-D) and a
  z-dependent `normfun` are deferred (see MATH.md §3.4). Test
  `test/test_native_free.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 7 — z-dependent linop assembly (narrow scope).** Ports the
  mode-averaged, graded-core constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` case
  (`Capillary.gradient(gas,L,p0,p1)`, a two-point pressure-gradient
  capillary) resident — `NativeSim::ensure_linop_at(z)`. `dens(pressure)` is
  a **transferred** `HermiteSpline` (Julia's own `Maths.CSpline`
  `(x,y,D)`, not re-fit — re-fitting a different spline through sampled
  values is a spline-of-a-spline problem that doesn't converge, see
  PORT_LOG). `β1(z)` is an **exact analytic closed form**, not a LUT: since
  `εco(ω;z)-1` is separable and `nwg(ω)` is z-independent, β1(z) reduces to
  4 z-independent constants computed once via `Maths.derivative` fed a
  `BigFloat` argument — see `docs/dev/native-port/BETA1_ANALYTIC.md` for the
  derivation, why this is *more* accurate than Julia's own adaptive-FD
  `Modes.dispersion`, and the resulting tolerance tradeoff (this is the
  first phase where Rust deliberately diverges from the Julia oracle to be
  more correct, rather than a faithful bit-parity port). Also fixed: the
  nonlinear RHS's `kerr_fac`/`beta[i]` must be rescaled by `dens(z)` every
  RK stage too (`TransModeAvg` re-evaluates `densityfun(z)` fresh each
  stage) — missing this caused a ~9% full-solve mismatch, found by isolating
  that a `kerr=false` control run matched Julia while `kerr=true` didn't.
  Scope: RealGrid, Kerr-only, two-point gradient only (multi-point gradient
  and radial/free-space/modal z-dependent `nfun` deferred — see MATH.md
  §3.5). Test `test/test_native_zdep_linop.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 8 — Default-flip + cleanup.** `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` default flipped
  to `"1"`; every Phases 1-7 scope restriction converted from a hard `error()`
  to a new `NativeIneligible` exception, caught by `solve_precon` and silently
  (one-time `@warn`) falls back to the Julia stepper — native being opt-in
  used to make a scope-restriction crash the right behavior; being default
  makes it a user-facing regression instead, so it must fall back. Running
  the *entire* test suite (not just the phase-specific groups) surfaced four
  real, pre-existing gaps invisible while native was opt-in: an unrecognized
  `f!` silently ran with zero nonlinearity (`test_rk45.jl`'s raw closures);
  gas mixtures crashed with a `MethodError` instead of falling back
  (non-scalar `densityfun`); `RamanPolarEnv` (GNLSE/envelope Raman) silently
  vanished (no `isa` branch matched it — closed generally with a catch-all,
  not a special case); and, most significantly, the resident field never saw
  `Luna.run`'s per-step windowing at all (`native_step` overwrites `s.yn`
  from Rust's own state, discarding whatever Julia wrote into the pointer
  between calls) — invisible because no native-specific test drives the
  stepper through `Luna.run`, fixed via a new `native_resync_field` FFI
  called after `stepfun`. A related, separate bug (dense output between
  accepted steps was linear, not Julia's quartic `interpC`) explained nearly
  every remaining general-suite failure at once — fixed via a new
  `get_ks_stage`-based `interpolate(s::RustNativeStepper)` and
  `native_apply_prop` FFI. Full details, including the tolerance-vs-bug
  triage for each affected general-purpose test, in `PORT_LOG.md`. Test
  `test/test_native_phase8.jl`. Gate met: `LUNA_TEST_GROUP=All` — 46590
  passed, 0 failed, 0 errored, 12 broken (pre-existing), with the baseline
  (`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE=0`) independently confirmed 100% green first. ✔

**Native-Rust backend port (Phases 0-8) complete.**

### 🟢 Per-kernel Rust FFI wiring — complete
All kernels in the original per-kernel wiring list are now wired. PPT
ionization is opt-in via `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION=1`.
The pattern: Rust exports an opaque handle lifecycle + a vector-eval FFI function;
Julia stores the handle in the struct and routes the in-place vector call through
`ccall`; a `@testitem tags=[:rust]` equivalence test guards the boundary.

Completed kernels:
1. ✅ **PPT ionization** (`IonRatePPTAccel`) — `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION` toggle —
   `test/test_ionisation_rust.jl`
2. ✅ **Time-domain Raman** (`raman.rs` `TimeDomainRamanSolver`) — toggle
   `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`, `init_raman_solver` / `free_raman_solver` / `raman_solve`
   exported, wired into `Nonlinear.jl` hot loop for carrier-field SDO responses
   (`CombinedRamanResponse` with all-SDO `Rs`, density-independent τ2) —
   `test/test_raman_rust.jl`. Follow-ups: rotational multi-oscillator (FFI already
   supports n_osc>1; needs Julia-side extraction of per-J Ω/K arrays);
   density-dependent τ2 (add `raman_update_coeffs` FFI entry); intermediate-broadening
   (Gaussian damping — ~~stays Julia indefinitely~~ now native via the resident
   FFT-conv kernel, Phase I item 2, 2026-07-08); envelope (`RamanPolarEnv`) Rust path
   (~~needs real-buffer copy~~ now native, Phase F item 2). Note these follow-ups
   landed in the *native-port* path, not this older per-kernel
   `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN` wiring, which keeps its original narrower scope.
3. ✅ **Waveguide dispersion — Zeisberger** (`dispersion.rs` `ZeisbergerNeff`) — toggle
   `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION`, `init_zeisberger_neff` / `free_zeisberger_neff` /
   `zeisberger_neff_vector` exported, wired into `Antiresonant.jl` via a specialised
   `neff_β_grid(grid, ::ZeisbergerMode, λ0)` that batch-evaluates neff over the
   positive-frequency grid per propagation step — `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl`.
   Full Zeisberger eq.(15) parity: all four mode kinds (HE/EH/TE/TM), ϕ wall-thickness
   phase, σ⁴ real (C) and imaginary (D·loss_scale) terms. Equivalence at ~1e-12
   (same formula + Julia-supplied nco/ncl → only float-reassociation differences).
   Follow-ups: Rust-side multi-term Sellmeier (offload nco/ncl computation too);
   const-linop one-time setup path (negligible cost, left on Julia indefinitely).

3a. ✅ **Waveguide dispersion — MarcatiliMode** (`dispersion.rs` `MarcatiliNeff`) — same
    `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION` toggle; `init_marcatili_neff` / `free_marcatili_neff` /
    `marcatili_neff_vector` exported. Wired into the constant-radius specialisation
    `neff_β_grid(grid, ::MarcatiliMode{<:Number}, λ0)` in `Capillary.jl`. Nwg(ω)
    precomputed ONCE at setup (cladding-dependent, z-independent) and stored in the
    Rust handle; per step only nco(ω; z) is passed. Also adds z-level memoization
    even on the Julia-only fallback path (batching all sidcs before returning cached
    values). Equivalence is bitwise (0.0 rel error) — same IEEE 754 formula + same
    Float64 inputs. Model `:full` (`sqrt(εco-nwg)`) and `:reduced` (`1+(εco-1)/2-nwg`)
    both wired. Tests: `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl` (second `@testitem`).
4. ✅ **QDHT batch transform** — toggle `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT`, `init_qdht_ffi` /
   `free_qdht_ffi` / `qdht_ffi_mul_real` / `qdht_ffi_ldiv_real` / `qdht_ffi_mul_cplx` /
   `qdht_ffi_ldiv_cplx` exported. Wired into `TransRadial` in `NonlinearRHS.jl` via
   type-stable `_qdht_mul!` / `_qdht_ldiv!` dispatch. Stores Julia's T matrix
   (transposed to row-major at init); per-call transform uses Rayon parallel
   row-vector dot products with pre-allocated scratch (4×n_r×n_time), avoiding
   the two `permutedims` allocations that Julia's dim=2 QDHT path incurs.
   Handles both `Float64` (RealGrid) and `ComplexF64` interleaved (EnvGrid).
   Equivalence: ~1e-13 relative error vs Julia BLAS path (summation order differs).
   Tests: `test/test_qdht_rust.jl` (`@testitem tags=[:rust]`).
   Follow-ups: wire `TransFree` (2D Cartesian FFT, different transform type — stays Julia);
   consider cblas/openblas DGEMM binding for peak throughput.
5. ✅ **RK45 interaction-picture PreconStepper** — Dormand-Prince 5(4) with FSAL and Lund PI
   step control implemented in `ffi.rs` (`init/free/precon_step_ffi`); Julia side in
   `src/RK45.jl` (`RustPreconStepper`, `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_STEPPER=1`).  Key fix: `@cfunction`
   pointers must be created in `RK45.__init__` (not as precompile-image `const`s).
   Tests: `test/test_stepper_rust.jl` (physical equivalence < rtol=1e-6).

- **Safety net:** `test/test_rust_ffi.jl`, `test/test_ionisation_rust.jl`,
  `test/test_raman_rust.jl`, `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl`, and
  `amalthea/tests/*.jl` (`@testitem tags=[:rust]`, auto-discovered).

### 🟢 Windows scan-lock validation — done (2026-07-08, found already validated by existing CI)
`amalthea/src/scans.rs` `FlockLock::lock`/`unlock` call real Win32 `LockFileEx`/
`UnlockFileEx` on non-Unix targets (commit `febdde1`, 2026-06-28). This entry
previously claimed "no Windows CI runner exists" — **that was stale, and had
been since the entry was written**: `.github/workflows/run_tests.yml`'s `rust`
group has included `windows-2025-vs2026` in its OS matrix since long before this
BACKLOG entry existed (`cargo test` runs there on every push/PR). Verified
directly against a real run
(`gh api repos/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl/actions/jobs/85999378123/logs`, run
28980961881, 2026-07-08):
```
test scans::tests::test_flock_lock_new_error ... ok
test scans::tests::test_flock_lock_new ... ok
test tests::test_scan_queue_flock ... ok
test result: ok. 37 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```
`test_scan_queue_flock` calls `checkout_next_index`/`mark_completed`, which call
`FlockLock::lock`/`unlock` — the real `LockFileEx`/`UnlockFileEx` path on this
runner, not a stub — and it passed. (The test does self-skip if HDF5 can't be
`dlopen`'d, printing to stdout; that branch wasn't taken here, since
`test_hdf5_io_basic` — same `get_hdf5_api()` call — also passed earlier in the
same job, before Julia's own HDF5 install step even ran, meaning the Windows
runner image already has a loadable HDF5.) **No code change was needed** — this
was a stale-documentation item, not an untested-code item.
- Currently latent in production regardless of platform — `ScanQueue`/
  `init_scan_queue` is only reachable via FFI, which `src/*.jl` doesn't call yet
  (confirmed: no `init_scan_queue` reference in any Julia source file). Relevant
  again once the Rust-side scan HDF5 writer (S6.2) is wired up.

### 🟡 GPU CI coverage
`amalthea/tests/test_gpu_cuda.jl` and the GPU numerical-equivalence tests in
`amalthea/src/lib.rs` self-skip when no GPU/CUDA is present, so the GPU code paths
(CUDA/Vulkan dispatch, GPU QDHT/Raman/ionization) are never exercised in CI.
- **Deferred fix:** add a GPU-equipped CI runner (or a scheduled job) that runs
  the strict `AMALTHEA_REQUIRE_CUDA_TESTS=1` CUDA Rust and resident CUDA items.
  The strict local RTX 5060 Ti baseline is evidence, not a replacement for
  standing CI.

### ⚪ Historical 2026-07-05 GPU-resident review — superseded

> This subsection is retained as provenance for the scaffolding review. Its
> "verified" and "not wired" statements describe intermediate states and are
> not current. The authoritative status is S3 above: the narrow slice is
> wired, repaired, and hardware-verified, but has no standing GPU CI.

A prior agent pass (2026-07-05, external review — see ARCHIVE.md's "Done
(recent)" entry for the GPU ionisation clamp, and `docs/dev/native-port/GPU.md`)
left a large uncommitted working-tree diff implementing three of `SUGGESTIONS.md`'s
performance ideas. Reviewed and tested (full `rust` gate: 42004/42004, no regression) —
findings below.
- ✅ **GPU PPT ionization clamp parity** (`kernels.cu`/`ionization.rs`): the CPU-side
  `strict` clamp-vs-error behavior (`Ionisation.jl`/`ionization.rs::rate`) was missing from
  the CUDA kernel (`ppt_ionization_kernel` unconditionally errored above `e_max`). Now takes
  `strict` as an argument and clamps `abs_e = e_max` when `strict == 0`, matching the CPU
  path exactly. Verified correct by inspection against `ionization.rs`'s own `strict` field.
- 🟡 **BLAS-3 QDHT** (`ffi.rs`, new `blas.rs`): `QdhtFfiHandle::apply_real`/`apply_cplx` now
  call `cblas_dgemm` via a runtime-`dlopen`ed BLAS (`init_blas_path`, new FFI export) when
  available, falling back to the existing Rayon path otherwise. Safe (inert until called) —
  but **no Julia-side caller exists** (`grep` for `init_blas_path` in `src/*.jl` finds
  nothing), so this is currently dead code, not a wired optimization.
- 🟠 **GPU-resident stepper V1** (`native.rs`: `NativeSim` → `NativeBackend` trait +
  `Box<dyn NativeBackend>`, `CpuNativeSim` = the renamed original; new `cuda_native.rs`:
  `CudaNativeSim`, scoped to mode-averaged RealGrid Kerr(+plasma) only, all other
  `set_*_params` return `-1` matching `docs/dev/native-port/GPU.md`'s stated V1 scope):
  - **Bug found and fixed (2026-07-05):** `CudaNativeSim::step` ran the 6 internal RK
    stages via `rk45_accumulate_stage_kernel` (`DP_B`, the intra-stage a-coefficients) but
    never performed the final 5th-order solution accumulation the CPU reference does in
    `native.rs` (`let b0 = dt*DP_B5[0]; ...` block, ~line 2521) — it just re-propagated the
    untouched old field, silently dropping the entire nonlinear RK contribution on every
    accepted step. Fixed by adding one more `rk45_accumulate_stage_fn` launch, in place on
    `field_d`, using `DP_B5` weights, gated on `locextrap != 0` exactly like the CPU
    reference, right before the existing final `apply_prop` call. Compiles clean, all 37
    Rust unit tests and the full `rust` Julia gate (42004/42004) still pass — **but this
    fix has still never executed on real CUDA hardware** (only checked for logical parity
    against `CpuNativeSim::step`, not numerically verified end-to-end).
  - **Opt-in gate added:** `init_cuda_native_sim` (the only FFI entry point that constructs
    a `CudaNativeSim`) now refuses to initialize — returns null and prints a warning to
    stderr — unless `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` is set, and prints a second warning on
    successful opt-in. Deliberately stricter than the usual `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_*` toggles
    (which default-on once verified): this one requires explicit opt-in until verified on
    real GPU hardware. Covered by `test_cuda_native_sim_ffi_gated_by_env_var` in `lib.rs`.
  - **Not wired to Julia at all**: no `src/*.jl` file references `init_cuda_native_sim` or
    the CUDA path; `RK45.jl`'s native dispatch is untouched. Purely additive scaffolding —
    zero risk to the existing (CPU) native-port default, doubly so now with the opt-in gate.
  - **Untestable on this machine**: no `nvcc` in `PATH` or at `/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc`
    (only the NVIDIA driver is present), so `build.rs` falls back to a dummy PTX and
    `CudaNativeSim::new` fails to load real kernels — `lib.rs`'s
    `test_cuda_native_sim_basic` self-skips (confirmed via `--nocapture`), so the GPU path
    has never actually executed on real hardware here.
  - Design-doc deviation: `docs/dev/native-port/GPU.md` §4 specifies an `enum { Cpu, Gpu }`
    dispatch ("no `Box<dyn>`... avoids dynamic dispatch overhead") but the implementation
    uses `Box<dyn NativeBackend>` instead — functionally fine, just not what was designed.
  - **Update 2026-07-07: verified on real CUDA hardware (RTX 5060 Ti, CUDA 13.3) and wired
    into `RK45.jl`** — see ARCHIVE.md's "Done (recent)" for the full list of bugs found and fixed
    along the way (this section's text above is left as historical record of the pre-hardware
    state).

### 🟡 Distribution & example-code maintenance — smoke coverage landed; repairs remain

Salvaged 2026-07-22 from a retrospective architecture review
(`ADR-001`, drafted 2026-07-20, not kept — see note at the end of this
subsection). Only the two findings that survived verification against the
tree are recorded here.

1. 🟢 **Install failure is documented and release machinery exists.**
   `README.md` and `deps/build.jl` explain the Cargo fallback and give an
   actionable error. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds three portable
   assets and `deps/build.jl` verifies checksums before installing them.
   🟢 The `v1.0.0` release's legacy `libluna_rust-*` asset names are now
   handled by a bounded fallback (resume-queue item 4), and source checkouts
   (clones, `Pkg.develop`, CI) always compile from source rather than install
   a binary older than their own FFI surface.
2. 🟡 **Representative smoke CI landed; seven broken examples remain.**
   `test/test_examples_smoke.jl` runs eight representative files at a shrunk
   5 mm propagation length in the `examples` CI group (16/16 assertions,
   ~45 s package time). It deliberately stops before plotting. The audit
   found 44 Julia files across 11 low-level-example subdirectories and seven
   distinct broken files outside the smoke subset:

   - `full_modal/basic_modal_full_bothpolarisations.jl`
   - `full_modal/basic_modal_full.jl`
   - `polarisation/modal_vector_plasma.jl`
   - `polarisation/modal_nonvector_plasma.jl`
   - `polarisation/modal_vector_plasma_CP.jl`
   - `polarisation/modal_vector_plasma_45deg.jl`
   - `polarisation/elliptical_env.jl`

   The first six reference `linop` before assignment; the two `full_modal`
   files plus `elliptical_env.jl` pass `grid.ω` to `norm_modal` instead of
   the required grid object. Fix them, then add at least one regression case
   for each failure class to the smoke subset. Full measurements and the
   plotting/AST-harness rationale are preserved in
   `native-port/portlog-inbox/hygiene.md`.

*Three further items from the same review were dropped after checking them
against the tree, recorded here so they aren't re-raised: (i) "confirm CI
exercises the AVX2/AVX-512/CUDA/Vulkan dispatch paths" rests on a false
premise — `dispatch.rs` is detection-only and unwired (`HardwarePath`/
`SimulationEngine` appear nowhere outside that module and its own unit
tests; Vulkan has no implementation at all), real vectorization comes from
`target-cpu=native` + LLVM auto-vectorization, and the real GPU path is the
opt-in `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` `CudaNativeSim`; (ii) "write a
contributor guide splitting Julia-layer vs Rust-crate work" is already
served by `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/dev/native-port/`; (iii)
"establish a process for tracking upstream Luna.jl changes" already exists
as `.github/workflows/upstream_sync.yml`. The ADR itself was not committed:
its central premise — automatic runtime hardware dispatch as a shipped
design decision — describes an architecture this repo does not have, and
that error propagated through its complexity assessment, risk analysis, and
consequences, so correcting it would have meant rewriting rather than
amending it.*

## Informational / no action planned

- ⚪ **`RUSTFLAGS` reach.** `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` now applies to every CI job's package
  build, because both workflows force the from-source path
  (`AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`, see resume item 4) — so a new crate
  warning fails all jobs, not just the `rust` group's explicit steps, which
  neutralize `RUSTFLAGS` themselves.

- ⚪ `deps/build.jl` forwards `ENV["RUSTFLAGS"]` (defaulting to `""` if unset),
  which neutralizes `.cargo/config.toml`'s `target-cpu=native` for
  package-driven builds. This is the portability safeguard: the resulting
  binary uses the compiler's portable baseline plus ordinary LLVM
  auto-vectorization. `dispatch.rs` does **not** select a propagation ISA at
  runtime; it is detection-only and unwired. `target-cpu=native` applies only
  to a manual Cargo build that leaves the repository config active. The one
  explicit runtime SIMD kernel is Raman's AVX2 lane. **Note:**
  `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` sets
  `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` in CI, which propagates through `deps/build.jl` — so
  the package build runs under strict warnings (desired; keeps the Rust code clean).
