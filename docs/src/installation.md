# Installation and configuration

Amalthea requires Julia 1.10 or newer. The normal installation uses the
resident CPU backend and does **not** require CUDA, an NVIDIA GPU, `nvcc`, or a
Rust toolchain when a matching release binary is available.

## Platform support

The installer selects binaries using both the operating system and CPU
architecture. It never installs a binary for a different architecture.

| Operating system | Architecture | Release binary | Installation path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux (glibc) | `x86_64` | Yes | Download verified binary; build from source if unavailable |
| Linux (glibc) | ARM64/AArch64 | Yes | Download verified binary; build from source if unavailable |
| macOS | Apple Silicon/ARM64 | Yes | Download verified binary; build from source if unavailable |
| Windows | `x86_64` | Yes | Download verified binary; build from source if unavailable |
| macOS | Intel `x86_64` | No | Build from source |
| Windows | ARM64 | No | Build from source |
| Linux | ARMv6/ARMv7, musl, or another architecture/libc | No | Build from source; not release-tested |
| Other Julia-supported systems | Varies | No | Source-build fallback; not release-tested |

The Linux ARM64 release job uses Ubuntu 22.04 to avoid imposing the newer
glibc baseline of Ubuntu 24.04. A machine with an older or incompatible libc
can still compile the library locally.

WSL follows the Linux row, not the Windows row. Check the platform Julia sees
with:

```julia
julia> (Sys.KERNEL, Sys.ARCH)
(:Linux, :x86_64)
```

## Tagged installation on current release platforms

Install Julia from [julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/),
start Julia, and enter package mode with `]`. Amalthea is not yet registered in
Julia's General registry, so install a tagged release directly from GitHub.
The current release is `v1.0.4`:

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl#v1.0.4
```

The equivalent programmatic command is the same on every operating system:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl", rev="v1.0.4")
```

Use the newest tag shown on the project's
[Releases page](https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl/releases). Do not omit
the tag unless a source build of the development branch is intended.

The `v1.0.4` binaries cover Linux `x86_64`, Linux ARM64, macOS Apple Silicon,
and Windows `x86_64`. Other OS/architecture combinations use the
architecture-safe source fallback.

During installation, `deps/build.jl`:

1. identifies the exact OS/architecture pair;
2. downloads the package version's release library when one exists;
3. verifies it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`;
4. otherwise runs `cargo build --release` from source.

Binaries produced by the current release workflow are CPU-only. CUDA libraries
are loaded dynamically only if the experimental CUDA backend is explicitly
enabled later.

Verify the installation:

```julia
using Amalthea
Amalthea.backend_report()
```

`last_stepper_type` is `nothing` until a propagation has run. The normal
configuration reports `native = true`, `cuda_native = false`, and
`gpu_dispatch = :auto`.

## When Rust is required

Install Rust 1.85 or newer when any of these apply:

- no prebuilt release binary exists for the platform;
- the prebuilt download is unavailable or deliberately disabled;
- installing the development branch or working from a git checkout;
- building CUDA kernels.

Install Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and open a new terminal so
`cargo` is on `PATH`. Confirm it with:

```text
cargo --version
```

The operating system must also provide its normal native linker:

- **Linux, including ARM64:** install the distribution's C build tools (for
  example, the package commonly named `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **macOS:** install the Xcode Command Line Tools with
  `xcode-select --install`.
- **Windows:** use rustup's default MSVC toolchain and install the Visual Studio
  C++ Build Tools when rustup requests them.

CUDA is not part of these source-build prerequisites.

## Development checkout

A checkout always builds from source because its Julia and Rust FFI code may
be newer than the latest tagged binary:

```text
git clone https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl.git
cd Amalthea.jl
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); Pkg.build("Amalthea")'
```

On Windows PowerShell, the last command is also valid as written. To build the
Rust library directly:

```text
cd amalthea
cargo build --release
```

Direct Cargo builds default to `AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=auto`; package builds
default to `off`. Use `RUSTFLAGS=""` for portable or cross-compiled binaries,
because the repository's developer Cargo configuration otherwise selects the
build machine's native CPU features.

## CPU-only configuration

No environment variables are needed for ordinary CPU operation. The effective
defaults are:

```text
AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=off
AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE=1
AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=0
AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=auto
```

To force a CPU-only source rebuild without probing `nvcc`, use a fresh Julia
process that has not loaded Amalthea:

```julia
ENV["AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD"] = "off"
using Pkg
Pkg.build("Amalthea")
```

To use the Julia implementation instead of the resident Rust CPU backend:

```julia
ENV["AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE"] = "0"
using Amalthea
```

This is a correct but generally slower fallback and is also the numerical
oracle used by the native-backend tests.

## CUDA installation

CUDA is an explicit source-build option. It requires an NVIDIA driver and a
CUDA toolkit containing `nvcc`. Modern macOS systems do not have a supported
NVIDIA CUDA path and should use CPU-only mode.

Build in a fresh Julia process:

```julia
ENV["AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD"] = "required"
using Pkg
Pkg.build("Amalthea")
```

`required` skips CPU-only release binaries and fails if real PTX cannot be
compiled. If `nvcc` is installed outside the conventional location, set one of
these before building:

```julia
ENV["NVCC"] = "/absolute/path/to/nvcc"
# or
ENV["CUDA_HOME"] = "/path/to/cuda"
# CUDA_PATH is also recognized, especially on Windows.
```

Close that Julia process after the build. In a new process, enable CUDA:

```julia
ENV["AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE"] = "1"
ENV["AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU"] = "on"  # force CUDA for supported configurations
using Amalthea
```

Use `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=auto` instead of `on` to apply the measured automatic
dispatch thresholds. `off` always selects CPU. Both `auto` and `on` still
require the master `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` opt-in. Unsupported
geometry/physics combinations fall back to CPU; see the
[native support matrix](https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl/blob/main/docs/dev/native-port/NATIVE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md)
for the current CUDA scope.

An NVIDIA Jetson or another Linux ARM64 CUDA system must build from source with
its native toolkit. That combination is not covered by the CPU-only ARM64
release artifact.

If a CPU-only library is accidentally used with CUDA enabled, initialization
stops before loading the driver and reports that the package must be rebuilt
with `AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=required`.

## Environment-variable syntax by operating system

Setting variables through Julia's `ENV` dictionary, as shown above, is the
most portable method. For shell-level configuration:

### Linux and macOS shells

For one command:

```text
AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=off julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build("Amalthea")'
```

For the current shell and its child processes:

```text
export AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1
export AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on
julia
```

Put the `export` lines in the appropriate shell profile only if the setting
should be persistent.

### Windows PowerShell

For the current PowerShell session:

```powershell
$env:AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD = "off"
julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.build("Amalthea")'
```

For CUDA runtime selection:

```powershell
$env:AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE = "1"
$env:AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU = "on"
julia
```

To persist a setting for future terminals:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU", "on", "User")
```

Open a new terminal after changing persistent variables.

### Windows Command Prompt

For one `cmd.exe` session:

```text
set AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=off
julia
```

Then run `using Pkg; Pkg.build("Amalthea")` at the Julia prompt. This avoids
shell-specific nested-quote rules.

Use `set AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE=1` and
`set AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU=on` before starting Julia for forced CUDA dispatch.

## Configuration reference

Build-time settings are consumed by `Pkg.build` or Cargo:

| Variable | Values and default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD` | `off`, `auto`, `required`; package default `off`, direct Cargo default `auto` | Disable CUDA compilation, try it with CPU fallback, or require real PTX |
| `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD` | `0`/unset or `1`; default unset | Force the source-build path instead of trying a release binary |
| `NVCC` | executable path | Override the CUDA compiler location |
| `CUDA_HOME`, `CUDA_PATH` | toolkit root | Search `<root>/bin/nvcc` |
| `RUSTFLAGS` | Rust compiler flags | Set to an empty string for portable release/cross builds |

Primary runtime settings are re-read when backend configuration is queried:

| Variable | Values and default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` | `0` or `1`; default `1` | Enable the resident Rust CPU backend |
| `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_CUDA_NATIVE` | `0` or `1`; default `0` | Master opt-in for resident CUDA |
| `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_GPU` | `off`, `auto`, `on`; default `auto` | Force CPU, use measured dispatch, or force supported CUDA configurations |
| `AMALTHEA_QDHT_BLAS` | `off`, `auto`, `on` (`0`, `1` aliases); default `auto` | Force Rayon, automatically use configured BLAS above the measured QDHT threshold, or force configured BLAS |
| `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_DETERMINISTIC` | `0` or `1`; default `0` | Force the fixed-order Rayon QDHT kernel regardless of `AMALTHEA_QDHT_BLAS` |
| `AMALTHEA_NATIVE_FFTW_WISDOM` | `0` or `1`; default `0` | Opt into native FFTW wisdom import/export |

Boolean switches recognize exactly `"1"` as enabled. GPU mode recognizes
exactly `off` and `on`; other values resolve to `auto`, so use the documented
spellings.

Older per-kernel experimental toggles remain available for developers:
`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_STEPPER`, `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_IONISATION`,
`AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`, `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION`,
and `AMALTHEA_USE_RUST_QDHT`. They default to `0` and are not needed for
normal resident-backend use. `AMALTHEA_QDHT_BLAS` is shared by the legacy and
resident radial paths and defaults to `auto`.

Resident QDHT calls Julia's configured `libblastrampoline` provider; it does
not assume OpenBLAS. On macOS this means Accelerate is used when Julia has been
configured for Accelerate. For Apple Silicon correctness and topology tuning,
run `python3 test/performance_audit/run_apple_quick_test.py` from a checkout;
the runner restores the normal portable library after its diagnostic build.

## Updating, rebuilding, and switching modes

Because Amalthea is installed from GitHub rather than General, upgrade by
selecting the newer release tag. The current tagged release is:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/vdiego28/Amalthea.jl", rev="v1.0.4")
```

Replace `v1.0.4` with the newer tag shown on the Releases page when one is
published. The package's build step runs automatically after the revision is
changed; `Pkg.build("Amalthea")` can be used to repeat it manually.

Use a fresh Julia process for rebuilds, especially on Windows where a loaded
DLL cannot safely be replaced. After changing between CPU-only and CUDA builds,
restart Julia before running a simulation.

To force a fresh source build of the installed tagged release:

```julia
ENV["AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD"] = "1"
ENV["AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD"] = "off"  # or "required"
using Pkg
Pkg.build("Amalthea")
```

## Troubleshooting

### `cargo` cannot be found

No matching prebuilt binary was usable, so the installer selected its source
fallback. Install Rust through rustup, open a new terminal, verify
`cargo --version`, and rerun `Pkg.build("Amalthea")`.

### A prebuilt binary was expected but source compilation started

Check `(Sys.KERNEL, Sys.ARCH)`, package version, access to `github.com`, and
whether `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` is set. A source checkout always builds
locally. CUDA `auto` or `required` also deliberately skips CPU-only binaries.

### `nvcc` is missing or PTX compilation fails

CPU users should set `AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=off`. CUDA users should verify
`nvcc --version`, then set `NVCC`, `CUDA_HOME`, or `CUDA_PATH` and rebuild with
`required`.

### CUDA says the library was built without kernels

The installed binary is CPU-only. Close Julia, rebuild from source with
`AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=required`, and start a new Julia process before enabling
the CUDA runtime variables.

### A downloaded Linux library requires a newer libc

Force a local source build with `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`. The resulting
library links against the local system instead of the release runner's glibc.

### The package loads but a configuration uses Julia

Run `Amalthea.backend_report()` after a propagation. Unsupported native or CUDA
configurations deliberately use a correct fallback. Consult the native support
matrix before treating a fallback as an installation failure.
