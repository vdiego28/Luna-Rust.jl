# Plotting (PyPlot/PyCall) is a package extension (see [weakdeps]/[extensions] in
# Project.toml) — it is intentionally NOT built here. Building PyCall eagerly would
# force-install a Conda-bundled libpython even for users who never plot, and that
# bundled libpython crashes if Amalthea is ever loaded from Python via
# juliacall/PythonCall (two different libpython runtimes in one process). Julia
# users who want plotting should `Pkg.add("PyPlot")` in their own environment and
# `using PyPlot` before/alongside `using Amalthea`; PyPlot's own build step handles
# PyCall/matplotlib installation.

# amalthea: try a prebuilt binary first (docs/dev/BACKLOG.md S6 item 13), fall back
# to `cargo build --release` from source — the from-source path is kept as
# the canonical dev path and as the fallback for platforms/versions with no
# published release asset.
const _AMALTHEA_RELEASE_REPO = "vdiego28/Amalthea.jl"

# The repo was renamed `luna_rust` -> `amalthea` mid-development, but GitHub
# release v1.0.0 was published *before* `.github/workflows/release.yml` was
# updated to stage the new `libamalthea-<triple>` names, so its three binaries
# (and SHA256SUMS.txt manifest entries) are still named `libluna_rust-<triple>`.
# v1.0.0 is the *only* release with this problem — release.yml stages the
# canonical `libamalthea-*` names for every tag from here on — so the legacy
# fallback below is bounded to versions at or before it, not open-ended: an
# unbounded fallback would let a genuinely broken *future* release (e.g. a
# release.yml regression that silently reverts the asset name, or an asset
# upload that failed) masquerade as a working legacy-named install rather
# than surfacing as a download miss. See
# docs/dev/native-port/portlog-inbox/prebuilt-asset-compat.md for the record.

    _is_source_checkout() -> Bool

`true` when this package tree is a git working copy (`.git` — a directory for
a normal clone, a file for a worktree/submodule — sits at the package root).

Such a tree is a *source* tree: `src/` and `amalthea/src/` are generally ahead
of the last tagged release, but `Project.toml` still carries that release's
version until the next bump — so the version-keyed download below would fetch a
binary older than the FFI surface the Julia source expects and overwrite the
locally built one with it. That is not hypothetical: it broke every CI job on
2026-07-25 with `undefined symbol: native_compute_extra_stages` (a symbol added
after v1.0.0 was tagged), and would hit any `Pkg.develop` user the same way.

An installed tagged package (`Pkg.add(url=..., rev="vX.Y.Z")`) has no `.git`,
so the prebuilt fast path is unaffected for the users it exists for.

    _prebuilt_asset_candidates(triple, ext, version) -> Vector{String}

Asset names to try, in priority order: the canonical `libamalthea-<triple>`
name always first (so a correctly-named future release takes the fast path
without ever touching the legacy branch), then — only for versions at or
before `_LAST_LEGACY_NAMED_VERSION` — the legacy `libluna_rust-<triple>` name
that release v1.0.0 actually published under.

"""
    try_download_prebuilt(rust_dir; base_url=nothing) -> Bool

Download the release asset matching this package's version (`Project.toml`)
and the running platform's target triple, verify it against the release's
`SHA256SUMS.txt` manifest, and place it at the same
`amalthea/target/release/<libname>` path `cargo build --release` would
have produced. Tries the canonical `libamalthea-<triple>` asset name first,
falling back to the legacy pre-rename `libluna_rust-<triple>` name (bounded
to `_LAST_LEGACY_NAMED_VERSION`, see its docstring/comment above) if the
canonical name isn't in the manifest. Returns `false` (never throws) on any
failure — missing release, unsupported platform, network error, checksum
mismatch — so the caller can fall back to building from source.

A source checkout (`.git` present next to this file's parent) never takes
this path at all — see `_is_source_checkout`.

`base_url` overrides the GitHub releases URL (production default computed
from `_AMALTHEA_RELEASE_REPO` + the package version); this exists solely so
tests can point the function at a local HTTP server serving a fake release
layout — the production call site never passes it.

            Failed to $(no_cargo ? "find" : "compile") the Rust library `amalthea` from source.

            Amalthea.jl offloads its numerical kernels to a native Rust backend. A
            prebuilt binary is downloaded automatically for common platforms
            (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64); this system either isn't

            the download was skipped/failed, so `Pkg.build` fell back to compiling
            from source — which requires a working Rust toolchain (cargo >= 1.85).

            To fix this: install Rust via https://rustup.rs/ (or your system package
            manager), make sure `cargo` is on your PATH in a NEW shell/Julia session,
            then re-run `Pkg.build("Amalthea")`.

            the `AMALTHEA_RUST_SKIP_DOWNLOAD` environment variable is not set to "1"
            and that your network can reach github.com. Release binaries are CPU-only.
            To build the experimental CUDA backend, install a CUDA toolkit and set
            `AMALTHEA_CUDA_BUILD=required` before re-running `Pkg.build`.
